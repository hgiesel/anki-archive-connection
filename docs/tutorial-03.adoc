= Tocs and pagerefs

* using sections can only give you so much freedom
* basically, the hierarchy is a tree where the leafs are topics with content

* what if you:
** want to have one file under two topics?
** want to create subhierarchies without moving files, destroying links


* solution:
** using tocs and pagerefs


* a toc is special page, which is identified by a keyword in its name
* the keyword is the same, that identifies a section:
** by default "README"


Tocs create, next to the *rooted tree hierarchy* of sections and pages, the hierarchy of a *directed acyclic graph* (*DAG*)


* tocs create *pagerefs* which point to other pages
* these pages might be *tocs* as well

* you can also create referencing pagerefs, which still link one page to another, but doesn't contribute to the hierarchy
