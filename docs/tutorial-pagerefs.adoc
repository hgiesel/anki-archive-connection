= Tocs and pagerefs

.hierarchy
* this topic is inspired by systems like *ConnectedText* or *Zettelkasten*
* using sections can only give you so much freedom
* basically, the hierarchy is a tree where the leafs are pages with their content
* *rooted tree hierarchy of height 2*

.what if you...
* …want to have one file under two topics?
* …want to create subhierarchies without moving files, destroying links, etc.?
* …want to leave open the exact hierarchy until you've actually figured it out?

.solution
* you create a new hierachy system using *pagerefs* and *tocs*

.what are pagerefs?
* a pageref is a link that points to another page in your archive
** you can link to pages outside of the current section
** they usually contain the ark URI, e.g. "graph-theory::abcdefgh", and
*** are enclosed within formatting according to the file type

.what are tocs?
* a toc is special page, which is identified by a keyword in its name
* the default keyword is "README"
* tocs, together with the pages they reference, create a hierarchy of a *directed acyclic graph* (*DAG*)
** this is made possible, because tocs can reference other tocs, and multiple tocs can refer to the same file
* imagine your content pages, where tocs open a window onto this content
* if you want to create a link that should not contribute to this hierarchy, e.g to avoid cycles within your hierarchy:
** you "neutralise" it by prepending a `!` character

== Managing pagerefs with `ark`

* `ark pagerefs <uri>`
** shows you all pagerefs within a file

* `ark revrefs`
** finds all mentions of a file within the archive
