= Residuated lattices

== Residuated lattice

.residuated lattice; structure
* a structure `(L,≼,⋅,I,\,/)`, that is simultanenously:
.. a lattice `(L,≼)`
.. a monoid `(L,⋅,I)`
.. additionally, it has:
*** right residual: `∀x,z. ∃x\z`
*** left residual: `∀y,z. ∃z/y`

.residuated lattice; definition one
* such that `∀x,y,z. (x⋅y ≤ z) ⇔ (x ≤ z/y) ⇔ (y ≤ x\z)`:
* iff commutative monoid, `\` and `/` fall together:
** `∀x,y,z. (x⋅y ≤ z) ⇔ (x ≤ y|z) ⇔ (y ≤ x|z)`:

.residuated lattice; definition two
* monoidal multiplication, and residuals create two adjunctions:
.. `(x⋅) ⊣ (x\)`
.. `(⋅y) ⊣ (/y)`

----
x⋅(x\z) ≤ z ≤ x\(x⋅z)
(z/y)⋅y ≤ z ≤ (z⋅y)/y
----

== Residuated lattices: Examples

.residuated lattices; natural language
* we translate the operators:
.. `x⋅y` ≔ x, and then y (not commutative)
.. `x\y` ≔ if-had x, then y
.. `x/y` ≔ if-ever y, then x

.residuated lattices; natural language; example
----
x ≔ bet; y ≔ win (guess correct); z ≔ rich
x⋅y ≤ z -- bet and then win entails rich
y ≤ x\z -- win entails if-had bet, then rich
x ≤ z/y -- bet entails if-ever win, then rich
----

.residuated lattices; multiplication example
----
-- (ℤ,∣,gcd,lcm,⋅,1,/)
x⋅y ≼ z -- e.g. 5*2 | 50
y ≼ x\z -- e.g. 5 | 50÷2
x ≼ z/y -- e.g. 2 | 50÷5
----

.residuated lattices; addition example
----
-- (ℤ,≤,min,max,+,0,−)
x⋅y ≼ z -- e.g. 2+5 ≤ 10
y ≼ x-z -- e.g. 5 ≤ 10-2
x ≼ z-y -- e.g. 2 ≤ 10-5
----

== Residuated lattices: Euclidean algorithm

.remainder operator
* result takes the sign of the _dividend_

.modulus operator
* result takes the sign of the _divisor_

.modulus and remainder; example
----
mod( 5,−2) = −1
mod(−5, 2) =  1
rem( 5,−2) =  1
rem(−5, 2) = −1
----

.truncated division
* `r = a − n⋅trunc(a⌟n)`

----
x / y = sgn(x) ⋅ |x/y|
----

* gives rise to remainder operator

.floored division
* `r = a − n⋅⌊a⌟n⌋`
* gives rise to modulus operator

.Euclidean division division
* given `a÷n = q`, `q = ⌊a÷|n|⌋`
* `r = a − |n|⋅⌊a⌟|n|⌋`
* remainder is nonnegative always

----
-- given a%n=r
r = a −  n ⋅trunc(a⌟n)
r = a −  n ⋅⌊a⌟n⌋
r = a − |n|⋅⌊a⌟|n|⌋
----

== Heyting algebra

* a special case of a residuated lattice, where `⋄` and `∧` fall together
* unit `I` is the top element
* both residuals are the same operation, `x → y`

* every complete, distributive lattice is a Heyting algebra
