= Covers, chains, and atoms

== Covers

.covers; covering relation
* an element `x` is covered by `y`, or `y` is covers `x`, iff:
** `x ⋖ y = (x ≺ y) ∧ (∄z. x ≺ z ≺ y)`, i.e.
*** `x` is the predecessor of `y`, without any intermediate elements

.covers; pronunciation
* `x ≼ y`: x precedes or equals y
* `x ≽ y`: x succeeds or equals y
* `x ⋖ y`: x is covered by y
* `x ⋗ y`: x covers y

.covers; graded poset
* a poset `(L,≤)` can be graded, iff all maximals chains have same cardinality
* the *rank function*, `r: L → ℕ`, maps each element to its rank `r(x)`
.. compatible with order: `∀x,y. x ≺ y ⇒ r(x) ≺ r(y)`
.. compatible with covering relation: `∀x,y. x ⋖ y ⇒ r(x) ` 1 = r(y)+

.covers; rank level
* *rank level* is a subset of elements with given rank

.covers; translated to graph theory
* the order-theoretic version of graph-theoretical _heads, and tails_

== Chains

.chains
* any totally ordered subset of some poset:
** a _linear order within a poset_

.chains; height
* *height* of a poset is the *cardinality* of its largest chain

:1545158802764:
.chains; *saturated chains*
* no further elements can be added while still remaining a chain
* in finite chains: every pair of successive elements is a covering

:1546470555370:
.chains; *maximal chains*
* saturated chain with a maximal, and a minimal element

:1546470601058:
.chains; translated to graph theory
* are the order-theoretic version of graph-theoretical _walks_

== Atoms and coatoms

.atoms and coatoms; meaning
* generalizations of singletons
* let you "select" elements from lattices (posets)

:1545159622449:
.atoms and coatoms; atoms
* elements covering bottom, `⊥ ⋖ x`, i.e.
** minimal among elements excluding bottom

:1545159775205:
.atoms and coatoms; coatoms
* elements covered by top, `x ⋖ ⊤`, i.e.
** maximal among elements excluding top

'''

.atoms and coatoms; atomic poset
* a poset, iff `∀x\{⊥}.∃y. y ⋖ x`, i.e.
** every element excluding bottom succeeds some atom:
* every finite poset is atomic
* ⚠ interesting for infinite posets, e.g.
** nonnegative real numbers are not atomic (neither have atoms)

.atoms and coatoms; coatomic poset
* a poset, iff `∀x\{⊤}.∃y. x ⋖ y`, i.e.
** a poset where every element excluding top preceeds some coatom:
** i.e. `∀x. x ≤ c`, where `c` is a coatom
* coatoms preceed coatoms by means of reflexivity

.atoms and coatoms; atomistic poset
* a poset where every element of the lattice is a join of atoms
* relation resembles containment

.atoms and coatoms; coatomistic poset
* a poset where every element of the lattice is a meet of coatoms
