= Parts, colorings, trees

== Colorings

.vertex coloring
* each vertex is assigned a color
* the amount of colors required to color a graph is `œá(G)`

.edge colorings
* each edge is assigned a color
* a vertex coloring of its *line graph* `L(G)`

.face colorings
* each *face* of a planar graph is a assigned a color
* a vertex coloring of its *dual graph*
* `œá(G)` can't be above 4
** ‚àµ `K_5` cannot possible be planar

.line graphs and dual graphs

.signs

== Trees

* an undirected graph both:
.. connected
.. acyclic

* `v_0` is defined as the *root*

.Search algorithms

.search algorithms
. depth first search (DFS)
.. preorder
.. postorder
.. inorder
. breadth first search (BFS)
* all of the searches can be done l2r, or r2l

.Spanning tree

a spanning tree `T` of a graph `G`, is a subgraph, which includes all vertices
of G, with a minimum possible number of edges

.minimum spanning trees
* computational task

.Djkstra's algorithm
* you start from a certain vertex
* you look at the weight of the different edges
* you choose the smallest weight
* this way you select all the smallest weight, until you cover the whole tree

.Prim's algorithm

.Kruskal's algorithm

== Optimization problems

.graph combinatorial structures optimization problems
packing problems:: biggest, such that `‚ãÇi = ‚àÖ`
covering problems:: smallest, such that `‚ãÉi = U`

== Optimization problems: Covering problems

.covering problems
* asking whether a certain combinatorial structure covers another
** or big it needs to be (minimal)

.coverings; vertex cover
* subset of vertices, such that ‚àÄedge. ‚àÉvertex. edge is incident to vertex
* finding the *minimum vertex cover* is a classical problem

.coverings; edge cover
* subset of edges, such that ‚àÄvertex. ‚àÉedge. vertex is incident to edge
* finding the *minimum edge cover* is a classical problem

.coverings; set cover
* generalization of edge covers, and vertex covers:
** given a set `U`, the universe, and a subset of its powerset `S ‚äÜ ùí´(U)`
** we search for a subset of `S`, such that union is `U`

== Optimization problems: Packing problems

.packing problems
* asking how to pack a structure into a container as densely as possible
** or big it can be (maximal)

.packings; matching
* also called *vertex packing*
* a set of edges without common vertices
* finding the *maximum matching* is a classical problem

.packings; independent set
* also called *stable set*, or *edge packing*
* set of vertices, where no two are adjacent or there is no edge connecting the two
* finding the *maximum independent set* is a classical problem

.packings; set packing
* generalization of edge covers, and vertex covers:
** given a set `U`, the universe, and a subset of its powerset `S ‚äÜ ùí´(U)`
** we search for a subset of `S`, such that intersection is `‚àÖ`

== Parts

* a graph whose vertices can be divided into `k` disjoint sets is *k-partite*:
.. vertices in one set cannot be connected among each other
.. but may be connected to vertices in others sets
* these sets are called *parts* of the graph

* called *bipartite* iff `k=2`, *tripartite* iff `k=3`, etc.

.connected multipartite graphs; naming scheme
* a multipartite graph with edges between every pair of vertices from different parts
* have a naming scheme: `K_5`, `K_(3,3)`, etc.

== Weighted graphs

* graphs where vertices, or edges might be associated with a value

== Tensor product
