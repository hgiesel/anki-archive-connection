= Groups and backreferences

== Groups

.groups; special syntax
* âˆƒ some special notation within groups:
.. alternation `|`, e.g.
*** `(a|b)` matches either `a`, or `b`
.. concatenation `&`:
*** alternative for positive lookaheads on empty atoms

.groups; properties of alternation
* alternation can be either:
.. *eager*: takes the first option that matches
.. *greedy*: takes the longest option
** usually, they are eager

:1545075585487:
.groups; matching versus capturing
. *matching*: adds text to the matched text:
** asserting, or searching regexes are not affected much
. *capturing*: creates backreferences:
** most interesting for substituting regexes

:1545076093654:
.groups; types
* matching, non-capturing groups
* matching, capturing groups
* atomic groups
* non-matching groups
* comments

== Groups: Matching groups

:1545076268139:
.group types; *matching, non-capturing groups*
* notation: `(?:atom)` in Perl; `\%(atom\)` in Vim

:1545076364719:
.group types; *matching, capturing groups*
* backrefs can be numbered or named:
.. numbered capture groups: `(atom)`
.. named capture groups: `(?P=<name>regex)` `(?<name>regex)`

:1545076441808:
.group types; *atomic groups*
* notation: `(?>regex)` in Perl; `atom\@>` in Vim
* a possessive matching, capturing group
* quantifiers affecting the atomic group itself are not possessive, e.g.
** in `(?>oo?)*`, the `*` does not match possessively

:1545076558383:
.group types; example `/a(?>bc|b)c/`
* the regex will match `abcc`, but not `abc`
* alternative with possessive quantifiers: `/abc?+c/`

:1545147574570:
.group types; example 2
* `/(?>oo?)*obc/` matches `ooobc`, but not
* `/(oo?)*+obc/` does not match `ooobc`, but

.group types; atomic groups; why use them
* make regexes much more efficient by avoiding unnecessary backtracking

== Groups: Non-matching groups

:1545076689043:
.group types; *non-matching groups*
* don't match characters, just asserts them, or _matches zero-width_
* usually aid other, matching patterns

:1545076761331:
.group types; non-matching groups; notation
. *positive lookaheads*: `(?=regex)` in Perl, `regex\@=` in Vim
. *negative lookaheads*: `(?!regex)` in Perl, `regex\@!` in Vim
. *positive lookbehinds*: `(?<=regex)` in Perl, `regex\@<=` in Vim
. *negative lookbehinds*: `(?<!regex)` in Perl, `regex\@<!` in Vim

:1545077038019:
.group types; non-matching groups; position in relation to atom
. lookaheads succeed the modified atom
. lookbehinds precede the modified atom

:1547431630285:
.group types; non-matching groups; example 1
* matching `To` in `Todo`, but not `Tongue`
.. with positive assertion: `To(?=do)`, or `To\%(do\)\@=`
.. with negative assertion: `To(?!ngue)`, or `To\%(ngue\)\@!`

:1547431688070:
.group types; non-matching groups; example 2
* matching `art` in `Dart`, but not `Fart`
.. with positive assertion: `(?<=D)art`, or `\%(D\)\@<=art`
.. with negative assertion: `(?<!F)art`, or `\%(F\)\@<!art`

== Groups: Non-matching groups: Alternatives

.group types; non-matching groups; alternatives
. zoom anchors: `\zs`, `\ze`:
** substitutes positive lookbehinds and lookaheads
. keep the text out of the match: `\K`
** substitutes positive lookbehinds
. concatenation in groups `&` (only in Vim):
** substitutes positive lookaheads on empty atoms

.group types; non-matching groups; alternatives; examples
* matches the last atom, iff all concatenated atoms match, e.g.
.. `\(abcdef\&abc\)`, matches 'abc' in 'abcdef', but not in 'abcghi'
.. `\(<\w{4}>\&four\)` == `\v(<\w{4}>)@= four` matches 'four', but not 'fourteen'

.group types; non-matching groups; examples
. `groups\@=s` in Vim: matches 'group' in 'groups', but not 'group types'
. `/\v(Start)@<=Date` in Vim: matches 'Date' in 'StartDate'
. `/\vPenis(Pump)@!` in Vim: matches 'Penis' iff not followed by 'Pump'
. `123\zs456\ze789` in Vim: matches '456' in '123456789'

.group types; *comments*
* notation: `(?#comment)` in Perl
* used for writing comments in regexes

== Groups: Revisiting other structures

.redefining as groups; characters
* identical to series of _matching, non-capturing groups of width one_, e.g.
.. `abc` => `(?:a)(?:b)(?:c)`

.redefining as groups; classes
* identical to an alternation in a _matching, non-capturing groups of width one_, e.g.
.. `[abc]` => `(?:a|b|c)`

.redefining as groups; anchors
* can be seen as predefined _non-matching, non-capturing groups_, e.g.
*** automatically atomic
