= Quantifiers

== Quantifiers

.quantifiers
* quantifiers work on characters or groups, i.e.
** changes the count of atoms you want

.quantifiers; tokens or atoms
* anything that is seen as a unit
* any kind of modifiers operate on tokens
* e.g.
.. characters
.. groups

.quantifiers; quantifier types
. greedy, and docile
. greedy, and possessive
. lazy, or reluctant, and helpful

== Quantifiers: Greedy quantifiers

:1545010086454:
.quantifier types; *greedy*
* regexes try as often as possible, then scale down until match
* notation: `x*`, `x+`, and `x?`

:1545011650027:
.quantifier types; *docile*
* greedy regexes are almost always docile, i.e.
** regexes scale down again so other tokens can match

:1545011781160:
.quantifier types; *possessive*
* if greedy regexes are not docile, they are possessive, i.e.
** regexes try as often as possible, then scale down without backtracking
* notation: `x*+`, `x++`, and `x?+`

.quantifier types; alternative notation for possessive
* atomic groups are an alternative notation for possesive quantifiers:
** e.g. `(?>x)*` is equivalent to `x*+`

== Quantifiers: Lazy quantifiers

:1545011901294:
.quantifier types; *lazy*
* regexes try as few times as possible, then scale up until match
* notation: `x*?`, `x+?`, and `x??`

:1545011929160:
.quantifier types; *helpful*
* lazy regexes are almost always helpful, i.e.
** regexes scale up in order for other tokens to match

.quantifier types; alternative for lazy
* alternative notation for lazy quantifiers:
** greedy negated character classes
** e.g. `<.+?>` is equivalent to `<[^>]+>`

== Quantifiers: Repetition quantifiers

.quantifier types; greedy repetition
* generalization of other quantifiers:
.. `{0,1}` is equivalent to `?`
.. `{0,}` is equivalent to `*`
.. `{1,}` is equivalent to `+`
.. `{m,n}` matches between m and n atoms

.quantifier types; lazy repetition
* `{m,n}?` in Perl; `{-m,n}` in Vim
