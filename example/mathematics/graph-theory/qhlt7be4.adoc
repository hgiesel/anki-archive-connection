= Characters

== Definition

.characters; definition
* characters match a single character:
** i.e. they have a width of one

.characters; types
. *character literals*
. *character classes*
.. self-defined character classes
.. predefined character classes
.. equivalence classes

== Character literals

.character literals; definition
* matches a single character that is equal to the literal, e.g.:
.. `a`, `B`, `%`
.. ∃ some specials literals; e.g. `\n`, `\r`

== Character classes

.character classes; *self-defined character classes*
* matches any one character out of a set
* uses bracket notation: e.g. `[xyz]`:
** inside bracket notation `[`, `]`, `-`, `^` and `\` are magic
... `[` introduces a POSIX character class, or equivalence class
... `]` terminates the character class
... `-` is used for ranges; e.g. `a-z`, `0-9`
... `^` is used to negate a character class (match anything but); e.g. `[^.]`
... `\` makes a character nonmagic; no effect on already nonmagic characters

'''

.character classes; types of predefined classes
. dot
. shorthand character classes
. POSIX character classes
. equivalence character classes

.character classes; *dot*
* `.` is usually equal to `[^\n\r]`
* `\_.` matches everything, i.e. matches normal dot + newline

.character classes; *shorthand character classes*
* cannot be used within bracket notation
.. e.g. `\d` for digits, equal to `[0-9]`
.. e.g. `\u` for upper case alphabetic characters, equal to `[A-Z]`
.. e.g. `\l` for lower case alphabetic characters, equal to `[a-z]`
.. e.g. `\w` for word characters, equal to `[0-9a-zA-Z]`

.character classes; *POSIX character classes*
* can only be used within bracket notation
.. e.g. `[:alpha:]`, equal to `[A-Za-z]`
.. e.g. `[:xdigit:]`, equal to `[0-9A-Fa-f]`

.character classes; *equivalence character classes*
* can only be used within bracket notation
* used to match character _similar_ to a specific character
* useful for diacritics
.. e.g. `[=a=]` will match any of 'äàáāǎăa'
.. e.g. `[=o=]` will match any of 'øöóǒòōo'

== Unicode support

.Unicode support
* Unicode regex engines treat Unicode code points as characters
* in Unicode there are characters that are not graphemes, e.g. U+0030:
.. `\X` matches a single grapheme
.. `\xFF` and `\uFFFF` match Unicode code points
.. `\p{category_names}` are Unicode classes, that include Unicode characters
*** e.g. `\p{lL}` matches alphabetic characters beyond ASCII
.. equivalence classes can also be used for Unicode
