== Examples of regular expression engines

.Shell Glob
* limited functionality
* * ? [ ] ** !() ?() \*() +() @()

.GNU BRE
* metachars `[` `]` `\` `^` `$` `.`
* `\<` `\>` word boundaries
* `\b` `\B` word boundaries inside
* character classes with two brackets, `\1` `\2` `\3` `\4`

.GNU ERE
* metachars: `[` `]` `\` `^` `$` `.` `|` `?` `+` `{` `}`
* functionally equivalent

.Vim regex
* lacks `\b` and `\B`
* forwards search `\/` for literal slash
* backwards search `\=` for literal ?

* *magic* is the amount of special characters that don't need to be escaped:
** in magic syntaxes, many characters have a special meaning
** in non-magic syntaxes, few charachters have special meaning

.PCRE
* `\d`, and syntax like `(?:)` is PCRE exclusively

.JavaScript

** `.match`
** `.replace`
** `.search`
** `.split`

** `.exec`
** `.test`
