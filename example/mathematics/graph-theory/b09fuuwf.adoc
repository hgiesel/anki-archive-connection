= Properties of homogeneous relations

== Relations

.relations
* a relation is a subset of the Cartesian product `X×Y`:
** a *homogeneous relation*, or endorelation is a relation, where `X = Y`
** a *heterogeneous relation* is a relation, where `X ≠ Y`

.relations; heterogenous relations as functions
* heterogeneous naturally give rise to functions:
.. however arbitrary relations usually don't fulfill any properties
* relations don't tend to fulfill uniqueness properties (being one-to-one):
.. transitivity and totality imply non-uniqueness

.relations; homogeneous relations as functions
* homogeneous can give rise to functions, e.g.
.. identity functions are reflexive
.. involutions are symmetric

.relations; notation
* `R_X: X×X` is an endorelation over `X`
* `x R_X x′ ⇔ (x,x′) ∈ R_X`, where
.. `x` is related with `x′`
.. `x′` however doesn't need to be related with `x`

.relations; example of a total order

R_ℕ: ℕ×ℕ
n R_ℕ n+1, ∀n∈ℕ
(n,n+1) ∈ R_ℕ, ∀n∈ℕ

.relations; example of an equivalence
----
f: X → Y, g: X → Y

R_Y: Y×Y
f(x) R_ℕ g(x), ∀x∈X
(f(x),g(x)) ∈ R_ℕ, ∀x∈X

.relations; special meaning of homogeneous relation
* endorelations fulfilling certain conditions can give rise to:
.. graphs
.. equivalences
.. lattices

// endorelations form a _monoid under composition_

.Terminology for rest of document
* note that for the rest of this document:
** `R: X×X`, where `R = R_X` is not a function, but a relation
*** i.e. a subset of the Cartesian product
** `∀x,y,z ∈ X`

=== Reflexivity properties

.reflexivity properties
* determine if elements relate to itself, i.e. *identities*:

.reflexivity properties; reflexive
* `∀x.xRx`
* requires identities

.reflexivity properties; irreflexive
* `∀x.x ¬R x`
* prohibits identities

=== Symmetry properties

.symmetry properties; list (5)
* restricts the set of possible relations
** `if relation exists ⇒ condition`
** prohibits one or multiple of:
... one-way relatedness
... two-way relatedness (excluding identities)
... identities

.symmetry properties; symmetric
* `∀x,y. xRy ⇒ yRx`
* prohibits one-way relatedness

.symmetry properties; antisymmetric
* `∀x,y. xRy ∧ x'Rx ⇒ x = y`
* prohibits two-way relatedness:
** two isomorphic single elements are resolved to one

.symmetry properties; asymmetric
* `∀x,y. xRy ⇒ y ¬R x`
* prohibits identity and two-way relatedness:
.. implies irreflexivity
.. implies antisymmetry as a vacuous truth (condition is never given)

.symmetry properties; coreflexive
* `∀x,y. xRy ⇒ x = y`
* prohibits one-way and two-way relatedness
** ⇒ only identities

.symmetry properties; dense
* `∀x,y. xRy ⇒ (∃z. xRz ∧ zRy)`
* i.e. the order is not finite

=== Transitivity properties

.transitivity properties; list (2)
* determine the composability of relations

.transitive
* `∀x,y,z. xRy ∧ yRz ⇒ xRz`
* relations are composable

.intransitive
* `∀x,y,z. ¬(xRy ∧ yRz ⇒ xRz)`
* lack of compasibility, but may be

=== Totality properties

.totality properties; list (3)
* determine how relations cover the whole set:
** symmetry properties restricts relations, totality properties mandates them

.total
* `∀x,y. xRy ∨ yRx`
* every pair of elements is related in some way:
** ! implies reflexivity

.connex
* `∀x,y. xRy ∨ yRx ∨ (x = y)`
* every pair of distinct elements is related in some way

.trichotomous
* `∀x,y. xRy ⊻ yRx ⊻ (x = y)`
* every pair of distinct elements is related in one direction:
** ! implies irreflexivity and asymmetry

== Endorelations

.endorelations; notation
* *reflexive relations* are abbreviated ≤
* *irreflexive relations* are abbreviated <

=== Intransitive relations

.intransitive relations; list
. directed graphs
. undirected graphs
. discrete orders
. dependencies
. tournaments
. oriented graphs

'''

.intransitive relations; directed graphs, `R`
* intransitive

.intransitive relations; undirected graphs, `R`
* symmetric, intransitive

.intransitive relations; discrete orders, `R`
* reflexive and coreflexive, OR reflexive, symmetric and antisymmetric
* nothing but identity relations

.intransitive relations; tournaments, `R`
* reflexive, antisymmetric, intransitive
* _intransitive poset_

.intransitive relations; dependencies, `R`
* reflexive, symmetric, intransitive
* _intransitive equivalence_

.intransitive relations; oriented graphs, `R`
* irreflexive, asymmetric, intransitive
* _intransitive strict partial order_

=== Non-total orders

.non-total orders; list of non-total orders
. partial preorder/quasiorder
. equivalence
. non-strict partial order / poset
. strict partial order

.non-total orders; partial preorder/quasiorder, `≼`
* reflexive, transitive

.non-total orders; non-strict partial order / poset, `≼`
* reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive
* weak orderings are posets, with transitivity of incomparability
* not all elements are necessarily connected in any way
* but elements that are have a notion of order
* are depicted with Hasse diagrams

.non-total orders; equivalence, `∼`
* reflexive, symmetric, transitive

.non-total orders; strict partial order, `≺`
* irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive

=== Total orders

.total orders; list
. total preorder/quasiorder
. total equivalence
. non-strict total order
. strict total order

.total orders; total preorder/quasiorder, `≼`
* reflexive, transitive, total

.total orders; non-strict total order, `≼`
* reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, total
* this is one step above a *distributive lattice*

.total orders; total equivalence, `∼`
* reflexive, symmetric, transitive, total
* similiar to a monoid

.total orders; strict total order, `≺`
* irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive, total

.endorelations; example of having kissed
. irreflexive, because you can't kiss yourself
. symmetric, because kissing is reciprocated
. intransitive
** i.e. a undirected graph

.endorelations; example of a person being taller-equal than another
. reflexive, because you have equal height as yourself
. nothing can be said about symmetry
. transitive
. totality
** i.e. a total preorder

.endorelations; example of person being taller than another
. irreflexive, because you're not taller than yourself
