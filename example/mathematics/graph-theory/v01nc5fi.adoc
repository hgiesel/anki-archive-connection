== Definition

:1549914293534:
.state computation; notation
* computations of the type `s -> (a, s)`, a combination of:
... writer computation `(a, w)`
... reader computation `r ->  a`

== Connnection to state machines

.connection to state machines; state
* every value inhabiting type *state monad* is defined on:
** represents a state in the state machine machine

:1549914314678:
.state computation vs state machines; considered sets
* considering `State s a`
** "states": data type, the state is defined over, `s`
** "input alphabet": state functions
** "output alphabet": result type of the State type, `a`

:1549914325929:
.state computation vs state machines; functions
* coming from a state machines:
.. `T`, the transition function, and
.. `G`, the output function, turn into:
*** state transformer function `F: S×Σ → S×Λ`

.connection to state machines; difference of outputs
* in a *Mealy machine* all outputs are collected in a sequence
* in a *state monad* you can combine the outputs in whatever way
** this means, it is _much more powerful_:
*** the output type can change during the passage of the monad
*** outputs can decide the next inputs (inputs aren't static, but can be)

== State data type: Definition

* abstraction over a function `s -> (a, s)`

.Top-down explanation
* models computations that acts upon state:
** one or more variables that are required to perform some computation but are not among the arguments:
** makes these dependencies explicit

* OO languages encourage successive state in the form of _object fields_
* procedural languages use variables declared _outside the current scope_
* this behavior would be at odds with functional purity

.Bottom-up explanation
* `State s a` is an example of a state Type:
** `s` is the state type
** `a` is the result type

*  `s -> (a, s)` the type isomorphic to a State type:
** herein `a` represents the result, and `s` represents the state
** i.e. the other way arround


.Basic implementation
* `return 5` becomes `(5, s) :: State s Int`

----
return :: a -> State s a
return a s = state (\s -> (a, s))

(>>=) :: State s a -> (a -> State s b) -> State s b
m >>= k = state $ \s -> let (a, s') = runState m s
                        in runState (k a) s'
----

. runState m s
* is executed, which is feeding the first monad with the state, the monad will eventually be fed

. (a, s')
* the result of this first monad is (a, s')

. k a => k'
* the a is fed to `k` to output the second state monad

. k' s'
* the state which was altered from the first monad is fed into the second monad

== State data type: Differences to Reader monad

* the function that is abstracted produces two outputs:
.. the result
.. the new state
* the result is equivalent to the result of the reader monad, which is subsequently fed to all other monads
* the new state is different to the reader monad, where every function reads from the same environment
** whereas the state changes

.State functions
. `runState :: State s a -> s -> (a, s)`
** get both the result and the new state according to a certain state +
  record function to get isomorphic value
. `execState :: State s a -> s -> s`
** get the new state according to a certain state
. `evalState :: State s a -> s -> a`
** get the result according to a certain state

== MonadState functions

.MonadState
* `MonadState` is a typeclass that abstracts the behavior of `State` types
* `MonadState` models _things that maintain state_
* instead of working with actual functions, you create State monads, that return a function that model the wanted behavior
** `get` functions, that look like `State a s`, that produce some output `a`
** `put` functions, that look like `s -> State s ()`, that set the state `s`

.MonadState; state
* `s` is the state, `a` is the result
* wraps function into State
.. `state :: MonadState s m => (s -> (a, s)) -> m a`

.MonadState; get
* leave state unmodified; set result to state
.. `get :: MonadState s m => m s`
.. `get = state $ \s -> (s,s)`

.MonadState; put
* set state to argument; set result to `()`
.. `put :: MonadState s m => s -> m ()`
.. `put s = state $ \s1 -> ((), s)`

.MonadState; modify
* modify state with argument; set result to `()`
.. `modify :: MonadState s m => (s -> s) -> m ()`
.. `modify f = state $ \s -> ((), f s)`
