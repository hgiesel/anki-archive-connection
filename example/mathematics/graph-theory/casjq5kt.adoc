= Directed sets

== Ideals and filters: Directed sets

.directed sets; *upwards directed sets*
. nonempty set, with a preorder `≤`
. `∀x,y. ∃upper bound`, but not necessarily a least upper bound / supremum

.directed sets; *downwards directed sets*
. nonempty set, with a preorder `≤`
. `∀x,y. ∃lower bound`, but not necessarily a greatest lower bound / infimum

.directed sets; difference to semilattices
* every meet-semilattice is a dds, but not conversely
* every join-semilattice is a uds, but not conversely

== Ideals and filters: Lower sets and upper sets

.lower sets and upper sets; *upper sets*
* a subset `↑U` of a poset `(X,≼)`, s.t.
** `∀x∈U. ∀y∈X. x≼y ⇒ y∈U`

.lower sets and upper sets; *lower sets*
* a subset `↓U` of a poset `(X,≼)`, s.t.
** `∀x∈U. ∀y∈X. y≼x ⇒ y∈U`,

.lower sets and upper sets; principal lower, and upper sets
* lower, and upper sets that are derived from a single element

== Ideals and filters: Ideals and filters


.ideals and filters; ideals
* a subset of a poset `I ⊆ P`, s.t.
.. a lower set, a uds

.ideals and filters; filters
* the subset of a poset `I ⊆ P`, s.t.
.. an upper set, a dds

'''

.ideals and filters; principal ideals, and filters
* the lower, or upper set it is based on, is principal

.ideals and filters; prime ideals, and filters
* an ideal `U` is prime, iff
.. the ideal is proper
.. given x,y ∈ X, x∧y ∈ U ⇒ (x∈U) ∨ (y∈U)
*** if `U` is a prime ideal, `P\U` is a prime filter
*** prime filters reverse

.ideals and filters; maximal ideals, and filters
* an ideal, or filter is maximal, iff
** no strictly greater proper ideal, or filter exists
