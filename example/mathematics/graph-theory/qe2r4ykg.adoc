== Modes and flags

.modes
* mode modifiers change the mode of operation inside the regex engine
* difference between modes and flags:
.. modes can be turned on and off inside the regex
.. flags count for the whole regex expression

.modes; free spacing (?x)
* regexes become easier to read because whitespace looses meaning
* character classes are single tokens
* most things however can be broken up

.modes; other modes
. *case insensitivity* (?iatom)
. *case sensitivity* (?Iatom)
. *confirm before replacing* c

== Branching
// TODO

* conditionals:
** (?(if)then|else)
** it can be a lookaround or capture group (tests whether they exist)

== Looping
// TODO

* normally, regular expressions are regular
** i.e. they cannot match recursive expressions
** â†¯ many modern regexp engines support recursive expressions anyway

* balancing groups (could match `oocc` in `ooccccc` by counting the 'o')
* regex subroutines
* regex recursion

== Catastrophic backtraching
// TODO
