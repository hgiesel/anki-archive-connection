== Completeness

:1547303755568:
.completeness; *complete lattice*
* all, _not just finite_, subsets have meet and join:
** every complete lattice is necessarily bounded
** join of ∅ is ⊤, meet of ∅ is ⊥

:1547304001480:
.completeness; *conditionally complete lattice*
* every nonempty subset that has an upper bound has a join
* generalization of the completeness axiom on `ℝ`

.completeness; *compact elements*
* an element of a poset, where
** cannot be subsumed by supremum of elements not already above
.. `∀uds ∈ P. (∃ sup(D)) ∧ c ≤ sup(D) ⇒ c ≤ d ∀d ∈ D`
.. ∀T⊂S⊂P. sup(S), c≼sup(S), 

.completeness; compact elements; illustration

== Completeness: Algebraic lattices

.completeness; algebraic lattice
* a lattice, s.t.
.. a complete lattice
.. s.t. every element is a join of compact elements
