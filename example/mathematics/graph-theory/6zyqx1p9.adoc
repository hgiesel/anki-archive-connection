= Special Weighted graphs

== Flow networks

* a graph `G` with two special elements, and two functions:
.. `s ∈ V`, the source vertex
.. `t ∈ V`, the sink vertex
.. `cap: E → ℝ`, the *capacity function*
.. `flow: E → ℝ`, the *flow function*

* it follows the axioms:
.. `∄(v,u) ⇒ cap(v,u) = 0`
.. `flow(u,v) ≤ flow(v,u)`, called *skew symmetry*
.. `flow(u,v) ≤ cap(u,v)`, called *capacity constraint*
.. optionally: the net flow for each vertex is zero, except for source and sink, called *flow conservation*

== Matrices as weighted graphs

== Multigraphs

* edges are defined like in categories
