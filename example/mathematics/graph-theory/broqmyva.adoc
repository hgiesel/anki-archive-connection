= Posets

== Posets

.posets; definition
** properties are reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive
* fomalizes and generalizes the notion of ordering, sequencing, or arranging

== Posets: Special elements in `L`

.special elements; in respect to whole poset
. minimal element
. least element
. maximal element
. greatest element

'''

.special elements in poset; *minimal element*
* an element `l∈L`, s.t. `∄x ∈ L. x ≺ l`, i.e.
** it has no elements beneath it

.special elements in poset; *least element*
* an element `l∈L`, s.t. `∀x ∈ L. l ≼ x`, i.e.
** it is the smallest element in the poset

.special elements in poset; relation between minimal element and least element
* the least element is unique in the poset
* all least elements are also minimal

'''

.special elements in poset; *maximal element*
* an element `g∈L`, s.t. `∄x ∈ L. g ≺ x`, i.e.
** it has no elements above it:

.special elements in poset; *greatest element*
* an element `g∈L`, s.t. `∀x ∈ L. x ≼ g`, i.e.
** it is the biggest element in the poset

.special elements in poset; relation between maximal element and greatest element
* the greatest element is unique in the poset
* all greatest elements are also maximal

== Posets: Special elements in `S ⊆ L`

.special elements in order theory in respect to a subset `S ⊆ L`
. lower bound
. infimum
. upper bound
. supremum

'''

.special elements in subset; *lower bound* of `S`
* an element `l∈L`, s.t. `∀s∈S. l ≼ s`, i.e.
** `l` it would least in `S`
* `S` is said to be "bounded below" by `l`

.special elements in subset; *infimum* of `S`
* greatest in the subset of lower bounds, `inf(S)`, i.e.
** biggest element of `L`, that is still a lower bound to `S`

.special elements in subset; infimum; in totally ordered sets and empty sets
* in totally ordered sets: infimum is least within the subset of lower bounds
* if `S = ∅`, the infimum is the least element, iff it exists

'''

.special elements in subset; *upper bound* of `S`
* an element `g∈L`, s.t. `∀s∈S. s ≼ g`, i.e.
** `g` it would be greatest in `S`
* `S` is said to be "bounded above" by `g`

.special elements in subset; *supremum* of `S`
* least in the subset of upper bounds, `sup(S)`, i.e.
** smallest element of `L`, that is still an upper bound to `S`

.special elements in subset; supremum; in totally ordered sets and empty sets
* in totally ordered sets: supremum is least within the subset of upper bounds
* if `S = ∅`: surpremum is the greatest element, iff it exists

== Posets: Meet and join

.meet and join; meet function
* binary operator defined on lattices
* points out the infimum of a subset of `L`:

----
∧: L×L → L
l ∧ l′ ↦ inf({l,l′})
----

.meet and join; join function
* binary operator defined on lattices
* points out the supremum of a subset of `L`:

----
∨: L×L → L
l ∨ l′ ↦ sup({l,l′})
----

'''

.meet and join; laws
* meet and join are:
** associative
** commutative
** idempotent
*** allows you to treat posets as group-like objects

.meet and join; defined on posets
* meet and join are _partial, multivalued functions_ for posets:
** ⫦ following is always true: `x ≼ y ⇒ (x ∧ y = x) ∧ (x ∨ y = y)`
