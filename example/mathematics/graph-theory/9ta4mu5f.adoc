== Graphs

.graphs; definition
* a graph `G = (V,E)` is made up of:
.. `V`, *vertices*, or *nodes*, or *points*
.. `E`, *edges*, or *arc*, or *lines*, a subset of `V×V` connecting `V`

.graphs; interpretation as endorelation
* can be interpreted as a pair:
.. a set `V`
.. an homogenous relation (endorelation) over `V×V`

.graphs; graphs versus digraphs

.graphs; what is a transpose graph
* a given directed graph with same vertices, but each edge reversed

.graphs; difference to graph of a function
* the graph of a function is a way to portray heterogenous relations
* the graphs of graph theory are a general kind of homogenous relation

== Notions in graphs: Degrees

.degrees, definition
* the numbers of edges adjacent to a vertex
** loops are counted twice

.degrees; notation
* for a vertex `v`, you write `deg v`

.degrees; isolated vertex
* a vertex `v, deg v = 0`

.degrees; leaf vertex
* a vertex `v, deg, v = 1`:
** especially in trees

.degrees; pendant edge
* an edge adjacent to a leaf vertex

.degrees; adjacent versus incident
* for vertices `v₁,v₂`, and edges `e₁,e₂`
.. `v₁,v₂` are adjacent, iff connected by an edge
.. `e₁,e₂` are incident, iff they share a vertex
.. `v₁,e₁` are incident, iff the vertex is one of the endpoints

'''

.Handshaking lemma
* `Σ (deg v) = 2|E|`
** ⇒ in every finite graph ∃ even number of vertices with odd degree
* also called the *degree sum formula*

.Handshaking lemma; consequence
* the number of vertices with odd degree is always even:
.. otherwise Handshaking lemma would imply half edges
*** e.g. `Σ (deg v) = 5` ⇒ 4.5 edges

.Handshaking lemma; heuristical approach
. a graph with zero edges has degree 0
. whenever you add an edge, you either:
** two even degrees turn odd
** one even degree turns odd, one odd degree turns even
** two odd degrees turn even

== Notions in digraphs: Degrees

.degrees in digraphs; *head of an edge*
* the source of an edge

.degrees in digraphs; *tail of an edge*
* the target of an edge

.degrees in digraphs;
* *indegree*: the number of incoming edges
* *outdegree*: the number of outgoing edges
* degree: the sum of the outdegree and indegree

== Notions in graphs, and digraphs: Walks

.walks; definition
* an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, starting and ending at vertex:
** `(v_0, e_0, v_1, e_1, …, v_(k-1), e_(k-1), v_k)`
** each *edge* is adjacent to its two endpoints
* in German: "Kantenzug"

.walks; special types of walks (3)
. *paths*
. *trails*
. *cycles*

'''

.paths; definition
* a path is a trail where all vertices are distinct (except maybe first and last)

.paths; Hamiltonian path
* a path that visits each vertex exactly once

.paths; Hamiltonian cycle
* a Hamiltonian path that is also a cycle
* finding whether such paths exist is NP-complete

'''

.trails; definition
* a trail is a walk where all edges are distinct
** in German: "Weg"

.trails; Eulerian trail
* a trail that visits each edge exactly once
.. `G` has a Eulerian trail
.. ``∀v ∈ V. deg^- v = outdeg^` v`+

.trails; Eulerian cycle
* a Eulerian trail that is also a cycle
* necessary that zero, or two vertices have an odd degree:
.. iff two, the trail starts at one, and ends at the other
.. iff none, the trail can start anywhere

* Eulerian circuit, iff all vertices have an even degree

'''

.walks; cycles
* a cycle is a walk which starts and ends at the same vertex
** in a graph with `n` vertices, `v_0 = v_(n-1)`
** in German: "Zyklus"

.walks; *closed walks*
* a synonym for a cycle, as opposed to *open walks*

.walks; *girth* is the length of the shortest cycle of the graph

== Notions in graphs: Cuts

.cuts
* could be called *edge cuts*
* a partition `C = (S,T)`, of the vertices `V` into two disjoint subsets
** i.e. `S,T ⊂ V`
** important is that all edges have one endpoint in `S`, one in `T`

.cuts; cut-set
* set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition
** i.e. they identify the cuts
** `{(u,v) ∈ E | u∈S, v∈T}`
* ! this is not necessarily true in unconnected graphs

.cuts; size/weight of a cut
* in unweighted graphs: number of edges crossing the cuts is its *size*
* in weighted graphs: sum of weights of cut edges is its *weight*

.cuts; minimum cut; iff size/weight is not larger than the size of any other
image::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Min-cut.svg[]

.cuts; maximum cut; iff size/weight is not smaller than the size of any other
image::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Max-cut.svg[]

'''

.vertex cuts
* also called vertex seperators
* a vertex subset `S ⊂ V`, iff:
** its removal from `G` seperates nonadjacent vertices `a` and `b` into distinct components

.vertex cuts; articulation points
* also called *cut vertices*
* a vertex cut of size `1`
* a graph without articulation points is called *biconnected*

== Notions in graphs: Connectivity

.connected; *adjacent nodes*
* relation between two vertices that are both endpoints of the same edge
* if `p` has a length of 1, `u,v` are *adjacent*

.connected; *reachable nodes*
* relation between two vertices where ∃ a walk from `x` to `y`

'''

.connectivity in graphs; *connected*
* two vertices `u,v` are connected, if `G` has a path from `u` to `v`:
** otherwise, they are *disconnected*
** a graph `G` is connected, if every pair of vertices is connected

.connectivity in graphs; *maximally connected*
* its connectivity equals its minimum degree

'''

.connectivity in graphs; *super-connected*
* every minimum vertex cut isolates a vertex

.connectivity in graphs; *hyper-connected*
* every deletion of each minimum vertex cut creates exactly two componenets
** one of which is an isolated vertex

== Connectivity in digraphs

.connectivity in digraphs; *weakly-connected*
* a directed graph, iff replacing all directed edges produces a connected graph

.connectivity in digraphs; *connected*
* iff `∀u,v`, ∃ a directed path `u` to `v`, or a directed path `v` to `u`

.connectivity in digraphs; *strongly-connected*
* iff `∀u,v`, ∃ a directed path `u` to `v`, and a directed path `v` to `u`

== Components

.connected components
* a maximal connected subgraph of `G`
* each vertex and edge belongs to exactly one connected component

.edge-connectivity
* minimum number of a edges that need to be deleted in order to make a graph disconnected
