'''

.semilattices; *meet-semilattice*
* poset where meet is a function, `∀x,y. ∃!inf({x,y})`:
** i.e. has an *infimum* for any nonempty finite subset

.semilattices; *bounded meet-semilattice*
* a meet-semilattice with a a _least element_, or *bottom*:
.. identity under join, `∀x. x∨⊥ = x`
.. absorbing element under meet, `∀x. x∧⊥ = ⊥`

.semilattices; *join-semilattice*
* poset where join is a function, `∀x,y. ∃!sup{x,y}`:
** i.e. has a *supremum* for any nonempty finite subset

.semilattices; *bounded join-semilattice*
* a join-semilattice with a _greatest element_, or *top*:
.. identity under meet, `∀x. x∧⊤ = x`
.. absorbing element under join, `∀x. x∨⊤ = ⊤`

'''

.semilattices; relation to abstract algebra 
* semilattices can be seen as _commutative, idempotent semigroups_
* bounded semilattices can be seen as _commutative, idempotent monoids_

.semilattices; relation to each other
* every meet-semilattice can be turned into a join-semilattice:
** by reversing the order of the underlying poset
** and vice versa

== Lattices

.lattices
* both a meet-semilattice and join-semilattice
* fulfills the *absorption law*, implying the idempotent laws

.lattices; Absorption law
----
l ≡ l ∧ (l ∨ l′) ≡ l ∨ (l ∧ l′)
----

.lattices; bounded lattice
* both a bounded meet-semilattice, and a bounded join-semilattice
