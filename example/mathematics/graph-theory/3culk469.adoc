.pseudocomplements; pseudocomplemented lattice
* a *pseudocomplemented lattice* has a pseudocomplement for every element:
.. makes the lattice necessarily bounded
* examples of pseudocomplemented lattices, e.g.
** every finite distributive lattice
** every Heyting algebra

.pseudocomplements; skeleton
* the subset `S(L) = { x^∗^∗ | x∈L }`
** a join-semilattice

.complements; complementation

.complements; complemented lattice
* in a *complemented lattice* every element has a complement:
** a distributive lattice is complemented iff bounded and relatively complemented

* in a uniquely complemented lattice a unique complement:
** gives rise to a function *complementation*, mapping elements to complements

* e.g.
** bounded, distributive lattices

.complements; relation to orthocomplemented lattices
* every complemented distributive lattice is also orthocomplemented
* every complemented distributive lattice is also a Boolean algebra

== Complementation: Relative complements

.*relative complements*
* a lattice is relatively complemented iff:
.. given any interval of the lattice `[c,d]` (a bounded sublattice)
.. `∀a.∃b. (a ∧ b = c) ∧ (a ∨ b = d)`
* `b` is called a complement of a relative to the interval `[c,d]`

== Complementation: Orthocomplements

.orthocomplements; orthocomplementation
* a  mapping `a ↦ a^⊥`, s.t.
.. is a complement
.. is a involution, `x = ¬¬x`
*** `a^⊥` is called the *orthocomplement*

.orthocomplements; ortholattices
* orthocomplemented lattices, or *ortholattices* is a lattice with orthocomplementation
* satisfies *De Morgan's laws*:
.. `(a ∨ b)^⊥ = a^⊥ ∧ b^⊥`
.. `(a ∧ b)^⊥ = a^⊥ ∨ b^⊥`

.orthocomplements; orthomodular lattices
* puts another condition on orthocomplementation
* a weaker form of the modular definition:
.. `∀a,b,c. a ≤ c ⇒ a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ c`
* a orthomodular lattice is an ortholattice, s.t.:
.. `∀a,c.   a ≤ c ⇒ a^⊥    ∧ c  = c`
