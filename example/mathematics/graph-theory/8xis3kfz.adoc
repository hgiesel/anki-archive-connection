== Modularity: Upper semimodularity

.upper semimodularity
* also called just *semimodular* lattice:
.. `∀x,y. r(x ∧ y) + r(x ∨ y) ≤ r(x) + r(y)`
.. `∀x,y. (x ∧ y ⋖ x) ∧ (x ∧ y ⋖ y) ⇒ (x ⋖ x ∨ y) ∧ (y ⋖ x ∨ y)`:
*** elements cover their meet ⇒ elements are covered by their join

* coming from bottom, every seperation is immediately brought together again
* the dual of D2 is a lower semimodular lattice

== Mdodularity: Lower semimodularity

.lower semimodularity (2)
* the dual notion of upper semimodularity:
.. i.e. `∀x,y. r(x) + r(y) ≤ r(x ∧ y) + r(x ∨ y)`
.. i.e. `∀x,y. (x ⋖ x ∨ y) ∧ (y ⋖ x ∨ y) ⇒ (x ∧ y ⋖ x) ∧ (x ∧ y ⋖ y)`:
*** elements are covered by their join ⇒ elements cover their meet

== Modularity

.modularity (1,2,2)
* weaker form of distributivity
* finite lattice is modular iff both upper semimodular ∧ lower semimodular, ∴
.. `∀x,y. r(x) + r(y) = r(x ∧ y) + r(x ∨ y)`
.. `∀x,y. (x ∧ y ⋖ x) ∧ (x ∧ y ⋖ y) ⇔ (x ⋖ x ∨ y) ∧ (y ⋖ x ∨ y)`:
*** elements cover their meet ⇔ elements are covered by their join

* alternatively, it needs to hold:
.. modular law
.. modular identity

.modularity; modular law
. `a ≼ c ⇒ (a ∨ b) ∧ c ≼ a ∨ (b ∧ c)`, i.e.
** a restricted associative law:

.modularity; modular identity
. `(a ∧ c) ∨ (b ∧ c) = ((a ∧ c) ∨ b) ∧ c`, i.e.
** constructable from modular law, by substituting `a` with `a ∧ c`:

== Distributitivy

.distributivity; isomorphism (3)
* a lattice where:
.. operations of join and meet _distribute over each other_
.. alternatively, any lattice without sublattices isomorphic to `M3` or `N5`
.. alternatively,  every distributive lattice isomorphic to:
*** lattice of sets under union and intersection

.distributivity laws
----
-- meet operation preserves nonempty finite joins
a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)
-- join operation preserves nonempty finite meets
a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c)

.N5 lattice
image::https://bit.ly/2wPhc4O[N5]
* non-distributive, non-modular lattice
* also called *diamon lattice*

.M lattices

image::https://bit.ly/2Gkn7hZ[M4]
* non-distributive, but modular lattices

== Distributivity: Total order

* are connex, i.e. `a ≼ b ∨ b ≼ a`
* distributivity gives rise to total orders
* just a single chain

// TODO total order examples
