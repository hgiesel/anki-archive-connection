== Anchors

.anchor; definition as opposed to characters
* anchors match a position before, after, or between characters:
** i.e. they are *zero-width*, also called *non-matching*
** `pos1 char1 pos2 char2 pos3 ...`

.anchor; special notice
* when zero length characters, like anchors match:
** regex engine doesn't move on

.does `%s/^/> /` delete the first character?
* depends on the regex engine:
** in some regex engines, empty zero-width matches match following character

.anchors; types of anchors
. string anchors
. line anchors

. outer word boundaries
. inside-word boundaries
. attempt anchors

== Anchors: String and line anchors

.anchor types; *string anchors*
* only ever match at the start, and end of a _string_, not line; e.g.:
.. `\A` and `\Z`
.. '\`' and `\'` (GNU ERE)
.. `\%^` and `\%$` (Vim)

.anchor types; literal end versus practical end of string
. `\z` matches after newlines at end of string
. `\Z` also matches before newlines at end of string
** independent of multi-line mode

.anchor types; *line anchors*
* usually, `^` and `$`
* iff the whole string is a single line, equal to string anchors
* when working with strings with multiple lines, e.g. `"hello\nworld"`

.anchor types; multiline mode
* in Perl and similar regex engines:
** to enable `^` and `$` as line anchors, you need to use multiline mode
** usually uses the `m` flag

.anchor types; reason for multiline mode
* specifying a requirement `/^abc$/` would allow:
** 'abc\ndangerous_script();'
** that's why Perl uses multiline mode

.anchor types; line anchors; restrictions
* you cannot match character before `^`, or after `$`:
** use `\n` instead

== Anchors: Other anchors

.anchor types; *outer word boundaries*
. `\b` in GNU ERE; `\<`, `\>` in Vim
* âˆƒ three different positions qualify as word boundaries:
.. before first character of word, iff word character
.. after last character character of word, iff word character
.. between two characters in word, with one word character, one not
* shorthand class `\w` defines word characters

.anchor types; *inside-word boundary*
. `\B` in GNU ERE
* matches between word characters

.anchor types; *zoom anchors*
. `\zs`, `\ze`
** set the start and end of the match
** work like a combination of positive lookbehind and lookahead

.anchor types; *attempt anchor*, or *match anchors*
* `\G`
* match at the start or end of the previous regex attempt
* making global regexes and iterating over the result achieves the same
