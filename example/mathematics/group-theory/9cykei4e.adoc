= Invertibility

== Invertibility

.invertibility; scope
* works in a unital magma

* `a ∗ b = e`
* `b ∗ a = e`

* `∗: X×X → X`, `a,b∈X`

.inverbitility; intuition
* retraction allows you to experiment
* section allows you to retrace past steps

:1545408122167:
.invertibility; left-inverse
* `b` is called a *left inverse*, or *retraction* of `a`, iff
** `b ∗ a = e`

:1545408147239:
.invertibility; right-invertible
* `b` is called a *right inverse*, or *section* of `a`, iff
** `a ∗ b = e`

.invertibility; invertible
* an *inverse element* is an element
** `∃g: Y → X`, such that `(a ∗ b = e) ∧ (g ∗ f = e)`

* conversely, `g` is also called an *isomorphism*
** `f,g` are called *isomorphic to each other*

.partial left-inverses
* for a function to have an inverse, it needs to be injective
** if, you can restrict its domain to define a *partial inverse*

* the multivalued function is then called the *full inverse*
** the multiple values are then called *branches*
** e.g. given `f(x) = x^2`, the full inverse `g(4) = {2,-2}`
* very similar to *preimages* (!)

== Invertibility: Weak invertibility

.weak invertibility; scope
* work in a semigroup
** in semigroups, its also called pseudo-inverse
** generally, it's also called quasi-inverse

:1545407982777:
.weak invertibility; left weak inverse
* `y` is called a *left weak inverse* of `x`, iff
** `(x∗y)∗x = x ∧ (y∗x)∗y = y`

:1545408041625:
.weak invertibility; right weak inverse
* `y` is called a *right weak inverse* of `x`, iff
** `x∗(y∗x) = x ∧ y∗(x∗y) = y`

:1545408061096:
.weak invertibility; *weak inverse*
* `y` is both a left and right weak inverse
** `x∗y∗x = x ∧ y∗x∗y = y`
** if `∗` is associative, one implies the other

:1545408079701:
.weak invertibility; *pseudo inverse*
* `y` is called a pseudo inverse of `x`, iff
** `x∗y∗x = x`, but `y∗x∗y ≠ y`
** you can also think of a left/right pseudo inverse

'''

.weak invertibility; giving rise to other structures
* iff `x∗y∗x = x ∧ y∗x∗y = y`, then:
** `x∗y`, and `y∗x` are idempotents
** `x∗y` is the closure operator, or monad
** `y∗x` is the kernel operator, or comonad

== Invertibility: Cancellation properties

.cancellation; definition
* the notion of cancellative is a generalization of the notion of invertible
* being inverse implies being cancellative

:1545408809293:
.cancellation; *left-cancellative*
* `a` is left-cancellative, iff
** `∀x,x′. a ∗ x = a ∗ x′ ⇔ x = x′`

:1545409064169:
.cancellation; *right-cancellative*
* `a` is right-cancellative, iff
** `∀x,x′. x ∗ a = x′ ∗ a ⇔ x = x′`

.cancellation; *cancellative*
* both left-cancellative and right-cancellative

.cancellation; relation to uniqueness properties
. property of injection: `∀x,x′. f(x) = f(x′) ⇔ x = x′`
