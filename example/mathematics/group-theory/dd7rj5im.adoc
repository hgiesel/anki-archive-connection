= Group-like: Operations

== Operations with groups: Direct Product

.group operations; direct product
* categorical product in both `Grp, Ab`
* given `G = (X,∗)`, `H = (Y,◇)`, it is `G×H`, or `G∏H`

.group operations; direct product; notation
----
G×H = (X×Y, ○)
(x,y) ○ (x′,y′) = (x ∗ x′, y ◇ y′)]
----

.group operations; internal central product
.group operations; external central product

.group operations; semidirect product
.group operations; wreath product

== Operations with groups: Direct sum

.group operations; direct sum
* categorical coproduct in `Ab`
* given `G = (X,∗)`, `H = (Y,◇)`, it is `G⊕H`

* for two operands, it is the same as the direct product

== Operations with groups: Free product

.group operations; free product
* categorical coproduct in `Grp`
* given `G = (X,∗)`, `H = (Y,◇)`, it is `G∗H`

.group operations; free product; properties
* contains both G, and H as subgroups
* the most general groups containing these groups
* unless one of the two groups is trivial, it is always an infinite group
* similar to creating a free group

.group operations; free product; construction
* a *word* is a product in the form `s_1 s_2 ... s_n`:
** each `s_i` is either an element of G or an element of H

* a word may be *reduced* by:
.. removing an instance of the identity element
.. replacing a pair `g_1 g_2` by its product in `G`, and similarly for `H`
* every reduced word is an alternating product of elements of G,H:
** `g_1 h_1 g_2 h_2 ...`

* the free product `G⋇H` is the group whose:
.. elements are all reduced words in `G` and `H`
.. operation is concatenation followed by reduction
