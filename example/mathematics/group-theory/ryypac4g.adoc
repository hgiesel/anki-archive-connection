= Kernels

== Kernels

//- this should go to group theory, etc.
* examples include:
** kernels of linear maps (between vector spaces)
** kernels of group homomorphisms (between groups)
** kernels of ring homomorphisms (between rings)

.Kernels of group homomorphisms
----
f: G -> H
ker(f) = {x in X | f(x) = e_Y }
----

.Example 1
`|ker f| > 1`
* in group theory this equates to `f: X -> Y` and `a,b in X. a != b vv f(a) = f(b) = c`
* this means `f(x ** y^(-1)) = f(x) \diamond f(y{-1}) = c \diamond c^{-1} = e_Y`
* let's take the group homomorphisms `f: (QQ, `) -> (ZZ, `)` with

----
∀x, n ∈ ℤ f(n) = f(x/n) = n
"..then we can say.."
f(8/5) ` (- 5/5) = f(8/5) ` (-5/5) = 5 - 5 = 0
"..this means that.."
8/5 + (- 5/5) in ker f = -3/5 in ker f
----

* actually in this case `ℚ sub ker f`

.Example 2:
`|ker f| = 1`
* let's take  `g: (ℤ, +) → ({n∈ℕ} | n ∨ 1⌟n }, ∘)` , with

----
∀n ∈ ℕ₀.
g:  n ↦ n + 1
g: -n ↦ 1⌟(n + 1)
-- then we can say
g((-1) ` 1) = g(-1) ` g(1) = 1/2 @ 2 = 1 = e_Y
-- however
g((-1) + 1) = g(0) = g(e_X) = e_Y
----

* this implies `ker f = {0}`, which means this group homomorphism is *injective*

== Introduction

* the *order* of a group is the cardinality of the underlying set

.additive group
** a group with a group operation similar to addition

.multiplicative group
** a group with a group operation similar to multiplication

.trivial group
* a *one element group*, usually written `{e}`
** this element is the neutral element `e ◇ e = e`
** same applies to the *trivial monoid*, basically the empty list

Simple multiplication tables::
. 1 group with order 1: `ℤ/2ℤ`, also called the *trivial group*
. 1 group with order 2: `ℤ/2ℤ`
. 1 group with order 3: `ℤ/3ℤ`
. 4 group with order `4`
** where 3 are isomorphic:
** basically when thinking about an additive operation `1,3` are exchangeable
** only the placement of `2` counts

== Free objects

. consider the collection of all possible words formed from an alphabet
. one imposes a set of equivalence relations upon the words, where the relations are the defining relations of the algebraic object
. the free objects now consists of a set of equivalence classes

.free objects; magmas
* members of such sets are called *generators*
* free magma on a set of generators is the set of all bracketed words
* another way of thinking about it, is the set of binary complete, planar, rooted trees

.free objects; semigroups and monoids
* the free monoid on a set is the monoid whose elements are all finite sequences of zero
  or more elements from that set, with string concatenation as the monoid operation and
  the empty string as the identity element (denoted `epsilon`)
* the free monoid is denoted `A^*`
* the free semigroup is the subsemigroup of all elements except `ε`, denoted `A^`+`

* free monoids:
* they are even simpler:
** a free monoid on a set $$X$$ is the monoid of all finite strings using $$X$$ as an alphabet, with operation being concatenation
** identity is the empty string
** simply the set of all word, with no equivalence relations imposed
** this is what is symbolized by the *Kleene star*
** free semigroups are then symbolized by the *Kleene plus*

.free objects; groups
* called `F_S`
* we add an identity element, and inverse elements for all *generators*
* e.g. `{a,b,c}` could produce `abb^(-1)ab^(-1)ccc^(-1) = aab^(-1)c`
* the free group of the one-element set are the integers

* e.g. free groups in two generators:
.. one starts with $$\{e, a, b, a^{-1}, b^{-1}\}$$
*** there is not yet any assigned meaning to the letters $$a^{-1}, b^{-1}$$
.. thus one could equally start with $$S = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$$
*** set of all words $$W(S)$$ includes strings like "aebedce", or "abcd", etc. of arbitrary finite length with letters arranged in any order
.. one imposes a set of equivalence relations
*** denoting the congruence by $$\~$$, the free object is the collection of equivalence classes
*** in this example, the free group in two generators is the quotient:
.. $$F_2 = W(S) / \~$$ or $$F_2 = W(S) / E$$, where:
*** $$W(S) = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \| a_k \in S; n finite \}$$
*** $$E = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \| e = a_1 a_2 ... a_n ; a_k \in S; n finite \}$$

.free objects; abelian group
* basically a multiset
* you can model the integers, complex numbers, etc. with this
