= Identitites and absorbing elements

== Identities

.identity
* special element `z` for binary function, `∗: X × X → X`, i.e.
** combining absorbing element with any element of set is absorbing element
* can also be defined on a per element basis, i.e.
** each element has its own identity, or only some

.identity; scope
* identity can be defined in any magma
* unital magmas and monoids have a unique unit element
** sometimes called the *unit* or *unit element*

.identity; types
* *left-identity*:  `∀a. ∃e. e ∗ a = a`
* *right-identity*: `∀a. ∃e. a * e = a`
* *identity*: `∀a. ∃e. a * e = a = a ∗ e`

== Identities: Idempotence

.idempotence
* generalization of identity, i.e.
** element is its own identity
* necessarily an endomorphism

.idempotence; notions
. idempotent element
. idempotent unary function
. idempotent binary function

.idempotence; idempotent element
* `x ∗ x = x`, where `∗: X × X → X`, i.e.
** element multiplied by itself equals itself
** also called an *idempotent*

.idempotence; *idempotent unary function*
* `f(f(x)) = f(x) ⇔ f ∘ f = f`, where `f: X → X` i.e.
** `f` is an idempotent element under function composition

.idempotence; *idempotent binary function*
* `∀x∈X. x ∗ x = x`, where `∗: X × X → X` i.e.
** all elements in `X` are idempotent elements under `∗`

== Identities: Involutions

.involution
* generalization of identity, i.e.
** element is its own inverse
* necessarily an endomorphism, and isomorphism

.involution; notation
* `x ∗ x = e`, where `∗: X × X → X`, i.e.
** element multiplied by itself equals its identity

== Absorbing elements

.absorbing elements
* special element `z` for binary function, `∗: X × X → X`, i.e.
** combining absorbing element with any element of set is absorbing element
* defining on a per element basis doesn't really happen

.absorbing elements; alternative names
* also called *zero element*, or *annihilating element*

.absorpting elements; types of zero elements
* *left-absorbing element*: `∀a.∃z. z ∗ a = z`
* *right-absorbing element*: `∀a.∃z. a ∗ z = z`
* *absorbing element*: `∀a.∃z. z ∗ a = z = a ∗ z`
