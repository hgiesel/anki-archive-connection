= Automorphism groups

== Automorphism groups

.automorphism groups
* an automorphism is an isomorphism from an object to itself
** in some sense, a symmetry:
** a way of mapping to itself, whilst preserving all structure
* the set of all automorphism of an object forms the *automorphism group*

.automorphism groups; in Set
* called *symmetric group*
* automorphisms are permutations

.automorphism groups; in Met
* called *isometry group*
* automorphisms are isometries

.automorphism groups; in Vect
* called *general linear group*, `GLₙ`
* automorphisms are bijective linear transformations

.automorphism groups; in Top
* called *homeomorphism group*
* automorphisms are homeomorphisms

== Automorphism groups: Inner, and outer automorphisms

* in some categories, it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types:
* inner automorphism `Inn(G)`
** conjugation action by a fixed element, called the conjugating element
* outer automorphisms, `Out(G)`
** any automorphism, that is not inner, is outer

* exact sequence

== Symmetric group

.symmetric groups
* the symmetric group `S_n` on a finite set `X` is the group with:
** elements being all *bijective function* `X → X`, called *permutations*
** *function composition* being the group operation
** symmetric groups are *non-abelian* for `n > 2`

.symmetric groups; example of S₃
----
M = {a,b,c}
S_3 = {
  stay_same,
  cycle_left,
  cycle_righ,
  switch_first_two,
  switch_last_two,
  switch_first_and_last }
----

== Symmetric group: Notation of permutations

.Notation of a single permutation
----
1 stays on its place,
2 is put to fourth place,
3 is put two second place,
4 is put fifth place,
5 is put to third place
----

.with Cauchys two-line notation
* treating permutations as functions:
** first line shows the input order,
** second line shows the output order

----
( (1,2,3,4,5)
, (1,4,2,5,3) )
----

.with permutation matrix
* alternatively, permutations can be visualized with *permutation matrices*:
** square matrices of size n for each element of the set
** there is one 1 in every row and column
** they show where the elements are switched
** arrows go from center right / left to the outer bounds

----
[ [1,0,0,0,0]
, [0,0,0,1,0]
, [0,1,0,0,0]
, [0,0,0,0,1]
, [0,0,1,0,0]
]
----

.with cycles
* see below

== Symmetric groups: Elements

.transposition
* a permutation, which exchanges two elements and keeps the others fixed 
* this representation is not unique
* every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions:
** e.g. `(1 3)` is a transposition:

.transposition; example
----
( (1,2,3,4,5)
, (1,4,2,5,3) )
= (2 4) (3 2) (3 5)
----

.adjacent transposition
* any transposition in the form `(a a`1)+
* this representation is also not unique
* *Bubble sort* is an application of this fact

.parity of permutations
* an *even permutation* is a permutation consisting of an even number of transpositions
* an *odd permutation* is a permutation consisting of an odd number of transpositions
* from this we can define a functions `sgn`

----
sgn: S_n → {+1, -1}
sgn f ↦ +1, iff f is even
sgn f ↦ -1, iff f is odd
----

* the kernel of this homomorphism is calle the alternating group `A_n`
** i.e. the set of even permutations
** a normal subgroup of the Symmetric group

.cycle
* a cycle of length `k` is a permutation, where:
** `x, f(x), f^2(x), (f^k(x) = x)` are the only elements moved by the permutation
** we define a cycle with e.g. `(1 3 5)`, instead of using multiple transpositions
** order of a cycle is equal to its length
** two cycles are disjoint, if they move disjoint subsets of elements, i.e. they commute
* a transposition is a degenerate cycle of order 2

.derangement
* a derangement is a permutation without fixed points
* i.e. no element appears in its original position
* the *subfactorial* function maps `n ↦ !n`, where `!n` is:
** the amount of derangements in `S_n`
** as opposed to the factorial, which shows all permutations

.circular permutations

.order-reversing permutation
* a permutation, that reverses the order in a symmetric group
* can be given by n/2 transposition as `(1 n), (1 n-2), …`
** or, given in Cauchy notation:

----
( (1 2   … n)
, (n n-1 … 1))
----

== Conjugacy classes

* correspond to the cycle structures of permutations
* two element in S_n are conjugate, iff:
** they consist of the same number of disjoint cycles of the same length

.Example
----
(1 2 3)(4 5), (1 4 3)(2 5) => conjugate
(1 2 3)(4 5), (1 2)(4 5) => not conjugate
----

* a conjugating element of S_n can be constructed in Cauchy two-line notation, by:
** placing the cycle notations of the two conjugate elements on top of each other:

----
( (1 2 3 4 5)
, (1 4 3 2 5))

"can be written as the product of cycles:"

  (2    4)
(1 2 3)(4 5)
  (2    4)
= (2 4)∘(1 2 3)(4 5)∘(2 4) = (1 4 3)(2 5)
----

== Permutation group

* a *permutation group* is a subgroup of the symmetric group
* the order of a symmetric group of an underlying set `X` is `|X|!`

== Alternating group

* a special subgroup of the symmetric group

* the group of even permutations of a finite set
* the alternating group of a set of n elements is the alternating group of degree n
** `A_n`

* for n > 1, `A_n` is the commutator subgroup of `S_n` with index 2
** so, it has `n!/2`
** kernel of the signature group `S_n -> {1, -1}`

== Cayley's theorem

* every group `G` is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on `G`
