= Group actions

== Groups actions

* set-theoretic representation: *group action*
* category of affine spaces: *affine representations*
* category of vector spaces: *representations*

== Types of actions

* transitive
* faithful

.free action
* given `g,h ∈ G`, existence of `x∈X` with `g⋅x = h⋅x`:
.. implies `g = h`, or alternatively
.. if `g` has at least one fixed point in `X`
* regular

* primitive
* locally free
