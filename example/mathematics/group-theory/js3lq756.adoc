= Rings and fields

== Ring-like

.rings
* the triple `(M,+,⋅)`, where
.. `M` is an abelian group under `+`
.. `M` is a monoid under `⋅`
.. `⋅` is distributive over `+`

.rings; distributivity
* an asymetric relation between two operators:
.. left distributivity:  `∀a,b,c. a⋅(b+c) = (a⋅b) + (a⋅c)`
.. right distributivity: `∀a,b,c. (b+c)⋅a = (b⋅a) + (c⋅a)`

== Ring-like: Related structures

.rings; semirings or rigs
* a ring without additive inverses:
.. `M` is a commutative monoid under `+`
.. `M` is a monoid under `⋅`
.. `⋅` is distributive over `+`

.rings; rngs
* a ring without a multiplicative identity:
.. `M` is a abelian group under `+`
.. `M` is a semigroup under `⋅`
.. `⋅` is distributive over `+`

.rings; commutative rings
* a ring with multiplicative commutativity
.. an abelian group under `+`
.. a commutative monoid under `⋅`
.. `⋅` is distributive over `+`

.rings; commutative rings; example
* integers, `ℤ`

.rings; division Ring, or skew fields
.. an abelian group under `+`
.. `M\{0}` forms a group under `⋅`
.. `⋅` is distributive over `+`

* a ring where division is possible
** `∀m ∈ M\{0}. ∃m⁻¹ ∈ M. m⋅m⁻¹ = e`

.rings; division rings, or skew fields; example
* e.g. division ring of *quaternions*, `ℍ`

== Ring-like: Examples

.examples; zero ring, or trivial ring
* `{0}` obeys all ring axioms
** only ring where additive identity equals multiplicative identity

== Fields

.fields
* the triple `(M,+,⋅)`, where
.. `M` is an abelian group under `+`
.. `M` is an abelian group under `⋅`
.. `*` is distributive over `+`

.fields; alternative definitions with 4 operators
. a binary operation, *subtraction*: `−: M×M → M`
. a binary operation, *division*: `÷: M×M\{e} → M`
. a unary operation, *negation*: `(−): M → M`
** where `(-)m` is inverse to `m` according to `+`
. a unary operation, *reciprocal* `-⁻¹: M → M`
** where `m⁻¹` is inverse to `m` according `⋅`

.fields; examples
. *rational numbers*, `ℚ`
. *real numbers*, `ℝ`
. *complex numbers*, `ℂ`
** any field may be used as the scalars for a *module*
