== Group like

.group-like structures
* group-like is an abstract notion about combining things together
* a pair, `G = (M,∗)`, where
** an underlying set, `M`
** a binary endofunction, called *multiplication*, `∗: M × M -> M`

.group-like structures; properties
* these properties describe the power `∗` has over `M`:
.. properties of the set / additional functions: identity, and invertibility
*** note that there can be multiple identity or inverse elements
.. properties of the binary operation: closure, associativity, and commutativity

== Group-like: Magma to abelian group

.magmas
* most general notion of a group-like structure, `(M,∗)`
* fulfills the *closure axiom*

.magmas; closure axiom
----
∀ x,y ∈ M. ∃ z ∈ M, "or, applied to the operator"
∀ x,y ∈ M. x ∗ y ∈ M
----

'''

* the binary operator is _commutative for the identity element_

.monoids; notion as additional function
* in *group theory*, a group-like structure is only ever a pair
* however the identity element can also be seen as a nullary function:
.. `1_G: M, 1_G: m`

.groups; notion as additional function
** this relation could also be modelled with a function
* the binary operator is commutative between an element and its inverse

== Group-like: Quasigroup and loops

.quasigroups
* a magma with inverse elements, but _no identity element_
* inverse elements defined using the *Latin square property*:
.. `∀x,y. ∃a,b. x ∗ a = b ∗ x = y`

.loops
* a quasigroup with identity elements
* a lot that applies to monoids also applies to loops:
** `∗` is commutative for the identity element

== Properties of a group: Center of a group

.center of a group
* subset of elements that commutes `∀g∈G`, i.e.
** the abelian subgroup, as it will always include the identity element
** in fact a normal subgroup

.center of a group; examples
* `Z(G) = { z∈G | ∀g∈G, zg = gz }`
* `Z(Dih₃) = {e,a}`

.center of a group; for abelian groups
* center of the group is the group itself, iff the group is abelian

== Properties of a group: Commutators

.commutators
* *commutator* of two elements `g,h ∈ G` is:
** `[g,h] = g⁻¹h⁻¹gh`
** `[g,h] = e`, iff `g,h` commute

.commutators; *commutator subgroup*, or derived group
* `[G,G]`, subgroup of G generated by all commutators
** the smallest normal subgroup such that associated quotient group is abelian

.commutators; commutator subgroup; abelian groups
* `G/N` is abelian iff `N` contains the commutator subgroup
** ∴ the larger the commutator subgroup, the _less abelian_ the group

.commutators; intuition
* gives an indication to which extent group _fails to be commutative_
* different definitions used in group and ring theory

== Properties of a group: Group extension

.Exact sequence
.Solvable group
.Nilpotent group

.Normal series
* a group that is _almost abelian_
* used for solvable groups

.Central series
.Nilpotency series
