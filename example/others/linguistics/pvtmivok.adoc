= Phonology

== Phonetics

.phonetics
* concerned about phones:
** which are part of humanely possibly sounds made with the trachea

:1545179670610:
.phonetics; phone
* notation: `[a]`, `[b]`
* any distinct speech sound or gesture:
** opposed to phonemes: whether exact sound matters for meaning of words irrelevant

== Phonology

.phonology
* concerned about phonemes:
** entities that are distinguished by humans
** notation: /phonem/

:1545180079035:
.phonology; phonemes
* notation: `/a/`, `/b/`
* the smallest unit of sound in phonology, has e.g.
** sounds, tone, stress
* opposed to phones: used to distinguish one word from another in a particular language

== Phonology: Allophones

:1545180399411:
.phonology; allophones
* one of a set of phones used to pronounce a phoneme in a particular language

:1545180633177:
.phonology; positional variation
* specific allophone is predictable from the phonetic context

:1545180864888:
.phonology; free variation
* the allophone can be chosen freely from the set of sounds

== Consonants

* a consonant is a sound made with the complete or partial closure of
  the vocal tract

== Consonants: Articulation types

.obstruents
* a speech sound that is produced obstructing airflow:
.. stops, or plosives
.. affricatives
.. fricatives

.obstruents; stops, or plosives
* complete closure

.obstruents; affricatives
* transitioning from plosives into fricatives

.obstruents; fricatives
* limited closure making it turbulent

'''

.sonorants
* a speech sound produced with a continuous, non-turbulent airflow:

.sonorants; nasals
* airflow through the nose

.sonorants; flaps, or taps
* single constraction of the muscle

.sonorants; approximants
* articulators approching each other, but not quite closing:
** fall between fricatives and vowels

.sonorants; approximants; list
* palatal: i j
* labio-palatal: y ɥ
* velar: ɯ ɰ
* labio-velar: u w
* alveolar: - ɹ
* retroflex: ɚ ɻ

.sonorants; vowels
* without closure
* a vowel is a sound without closure of the vocal tract

== Consonants: Labial consonants

.consonants by articulation; labial consonants
* produced with the lips
.. bilabial
.. labiodental
.. dentolabial

.consonants by articulation; bilabial sounds
* nasal: m
* stops: p b
* fricatives: ɸ β

.consonants by articulation; labio-dental sounds
* nasal: ɱ

* fricatives: f v

== Consonants: Coronal consonants

.consonants by articulation; coronal consonants
* produced with the flexible tip of the tongue
.. dental
.. alveolar
.. postalveolar consonants

.consonants by articulation; dental sounds
* fricatives: θ ð

.consonants by articulation; alveolar sounds
* fricatives: s z

'''

.consonants by articulation; postalveolar sounds
* from most palatalization to least, or lowest to highest-pitched:
.. alveolo-palatal
.. palato-alveolar
.. retroflex

.consonants by articulation; alveolo-palatal sounds
* fricatives: ɕ ʑ

.consonants by articulation; palato-alveolar sounds
* fricatives: ʃ ʒ

.consonants by articulation; retroflex sounds
* fricatives: ʂ ʐ

== Consonants: Dorsal consonants

.consonants by articulation; dorsal consonants
* produced with the back of the tongue (the dorsum)
. palatal
. velar
. uvular

.consonants by articulation; palatal sounds
* nasal: ɲ
* stops: c ɟ
* fricatives: ç ʝ

.consonants by articulation; velar sounds
* nasal: ŋ
* stops: k ɡ
* fricatives: x ɣ

.consonants by articulation; uvular sounds
* nasal: ɴ
* stops: q ɢ
* fricatives: χ ʁ

== Consonants: Laryngeal consonants

.consonants by articulation; laryngeal consonants
* sounds with the primary articulation in the larynx (Kehlkopf)
.. pharyngeal, or epiglottal
.. glottal

.consonants by articulation; pharyngeal, or epiglottal sounds
* stops: ʡ -
* fricatives: ħ ʕ

.consonants by articulation; glottal sounds
* stops: ʔ -
* fricatives: h ɦ

** e.g. open-mid front rounded vowel

.vowel types
* close
