= Morphological Topology

.analytical
* contain very little inflection
* rely on syntax and auxiliary words to convey meaning

.synthetic; agglutinative
* rely on discrete particles (affixes)

.synthetic; fusional
* rely on fusing inflectional categories together
* original root can be difficult to extract

.synthetic; polysynthetic
* create entire senteces just by synthetic constructions

.transitiion
* analytical -> agglutinative -> fusional -> analytical
