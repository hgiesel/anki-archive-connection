== Grammar
Grammar::
* (the/a) set of rules for the organization of meaningful elements (morphemes) into sentences

== Morphology

* *internal structure* of words:
** e.g. "bookkeppers" has four morphemes:
*** "book", "keep", "-er", "-s"
*** put together using morphology
* morphological transform: book → books; is → was
* includes:
.. inflection
.. clitics
.. intonation

* term "word" has no defined meaning
* instead, two related terms are used in morphology:
.. lexemes
.. word forms

* a lexeme is a set of inflected word forms
** often represented in the citation form (lemma) with small capitals
** the lexeme EAT contains the word-forms "eats, eaten, ate"
** eat, and eater however are different lexems, as they refer to two different
concepts

* a lexicon is the collection of lexemes in a language

* given lexems, you can differentiate:
.. some morphological rules relate to different forms of the same lexeme
*** -> *inflectional*
*** yields variant forms of the same lexeme
** Allomorphy:
*** same inflections yield different results "goose,geese", etc.






.. other rules relate to different lexems
*** -> *word formation*
*** e.g. dog → dog catcher
*** forms new lexems from existent ones

** this distinction is not clear cut:
**** can change the grammatical category
*** inflection, you can combine it with affixes


.Types of word formation
* *derivation*
** involves affixing bound forms to existing lexemes
** e.g. independent, from dependent
** clipping, portion of a word is removed
** blending, in which two parts of different words are blended into one
** acronyms
** borrowing
** coinage, in which a new word is created to represent a new object or concept

* *compounding*
** word formation, about combining two complete words


* a *linguistic paradigm* is a set of related word forms associated with a given
  lexeme
* familar examples of paradigms are conjugations of verbs, and declensions of
  nouns

== Clitics

* syntactically independent but phonologically dependent, attached to a host
* like an affix, but a syntactic role at the phrase level
** clitics have the form of affixes, but the distribution of function words

== Adpositions

== Lexeme

== Morphemes


== Morphological typology

* different approaches to match the different morphologies:


.Morpheme-based morphology
* *item-and-arrangement* approch
* agglutanative languages

* word forms ar analyzed as arrangements of morphemes
* morpheme is defined as the minimal meaningful unit of a language

* morpheme may have two meaning:
.. Bloomfeldian: morpheme is the minimal form with meaning, but without meaning
itself:
*** e.g. "-s"
.. HOckettian: morphemes are "meaning elements", not "form" elements
*** e.g. the morpheme plural

.Lexeme-based morphology
* *item-and-process* approch
* fusional languages

** instead of analyzing a word as a set of morphemes, arranged in sequence
*** word form is said to be the result of applying rules that a word form or
stem in order to produce a new one
*** inflectional rule takes a stem, changes it per requirements, and outputs a
derived stem
*** a compounding rule takes a word form and similarly outputs a compound stem


.Word-based morphology
* *word-and-paradigm* approch
* fusional languages

** takes paradigms as a central notion
** instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms, or to generate
word forms from stems:
*** states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflected paradigms
*** examples to show the effectiveness, is usually fusional languages
*** given a piece of a word, morpheme based theory would call an inflectional
morpheme, coressonds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example
third person plural

*** no problems with this sitatuion since one that says 

Inflectional morphology

* affixation
* reduplication
* alternation
* suprasegmental variations













== Syntax

* *external structure* of words
* syntactical transform: "For me it's great" -> "It's great for me"
* includes:
.. word order
.. word agreement



== Types of words

== Part of speech

.categories of words
.. functions words (functors)
<->
.. content words (lexical words)

open classes <->
closed classes

== Noun phrases

* possible parts:
** determiners
* attributive adjectives
* adjectives phrases
* noun adjuncts
preop...

== Verb phrases

Constituency structure / Phrase structure grammars

Dependency structure / Dependency grammar

.nonfinite verb
* generally not inflected by grammatical categories
** also lack a subject dependent
* in english:
.. infinitives
.. participles
.. gerunds
.. others: converbs, gerundives, supines

.finite verb
* do conjugation

.verb catena
















== Dependent clauses

Content clauses::
Adjective clauses/Relative clauses::
Adverbial clauses::

* conjunctions connect clauses
* three types:
** coordinating
** correlative
** subordinating
* prepositions show connections between nouns

* relative adverbs v. relative pronouns:
** when, where v that, who
