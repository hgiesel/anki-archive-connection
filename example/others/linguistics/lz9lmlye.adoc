== Valency

.valency; definition
* number of arguments controlled by a verbal predicate can take

.valency; types
. *impersonal* (avalent), e.g. "(It) rains"
. *intransitive* (monovalent), e.g. "He sleeps"
. *transitive* (divalent), e.g. "He kicks the ball"
. *ditransitive* (trivalent), e.g. "He gave her a flower"

== Valency: Intransitive verbs

.unergative verbs
* intransitive verb where grammatical subject is the semantic agent
** "Mary ran", "The children worked hard"

.unaccusative verbs
* intransitive verb where grammatical subject is the semantic patient
* act as verbs where the semantic patient, is not in accusative position, e.g.
** "the window broke", "the tree fell", "the man died"

.controversy
* some intransitive verbs can be considered both
** depends on whether action was voluntary or involuntary, e.g.
** "slide": "the door slid open", "he slided over the ice"

== Valency: Transitive verbs

.accusative verbs
* requires all objects, e.g.
** "you fed the dog yesterday", but not "you fed yesterday", but "you fed him yesterday"

.object-deletion verbs
* can be transitive, or intransitive, e.g.
** "we have already eaten dinner", or "we have already eaten"
** like unergative verb, or antipassive

.ergative verbs
* can be transitive, or intransitive
* subject when intransitive becomes direct object when transitive, e.g.
** "the submarine sank the freighter", or "the freightener sank"
** like unaccusative verb, or passive

== Valency changing operations: Valency decreasing

.passive voice
* in nominative-accusative languages, turns accusative case into nominative case, e.g.
** "He-NOM is speaking the truth-ACC" -> "The truth-NOM is being spoken"
* typically, in passive clauses what is usually expressed by the object is now the subject

* not necssarily valency decreasing, e.g. in Japanese

* deleted objects can be reintroduced as *arguments*:
* complete the meaning of the predicate (verb phrase)

.adversative passive voice
* works like ordinary passive in syntactic nature
* indicates somebody was negatively affected
* "花子が 隣の学生に ピアノを 朝まで惹かれた。"
* => Hanako was adversely affected by the neighbor playing the piano

.antipassive voice
* in absolutive-nominative languages, turns ergative case into absolutive case, e.g.
** "He-ERG is speaking the truth-ABS." -> "He-ABS is speaking"

.relation between voices and verb types
* they sank the ship
* the ship was sunk
* the ship sank

* sie versenken das Schiff
* das Schiff wurde versenkt
* das Schiff sinkte
** => English is way more ergative than German

== Valency changing operations: Valency increasing

.causative voice

.applicative voice
* promotes an oblique argument of a verb to a core argument
* many languages have dedicated morphology for applicative uses
* especially in highly agglutinative languages, like Bantu languages

* e.g. in English "run" → "outrun" is similar to an applicative voice
** "Jack ran faster than the giant"
** "Jack outran the giant" → "The giant was outrun by Jack"

.benefactive case

.dative shift
