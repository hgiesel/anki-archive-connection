= HTTP Methods
:stats: web-development:mzpbsbvy,0,183

== General

* sequence of requests / responses
* request methods / verbs:
* what it means specifically depends on server
* corresponds to file or executable on server
* no limit on methods; you can define them yourself
* builds on a persistent connection (TCP)
* with 1.1 keep-alive:
** one connection can be reused
* HTTP is stateless, but it can be mimicked with cookies, hidden vars, etc.
* HTTP by default doesn't send information about the origin of a request
* a name collision describes an attempt to resolve a private name, that leaks to a public DNS

* Host:
** a host is a computer connected to a network:
*** each has their own IP address
*** offers information, resources, services, etc.
*** can be identified by a domain, or an IP address
** a port is an endpoint in an operating system:
*** can be identified by a port number

== Request message

* request line
* request header fields
* host header
* empty line
* optional message body

== Request methods

* also called HTTP methods

* `GET`    : safe
* `HEAD`   : safe
* `OPTIONS`: safe
* `TRACE`  : safe

* `PUT`     : idempotent
* `DELETE`  : idempotent
* `POST`    : unsafe
* `PATCH`   : unsafe
* `CONNECT` : ??

- question: Are changes made to the world
** no: safe
** changes are done, but the function can be repeated without any further changes: idempotent
** yes, every time it's called: unsafe


safe method: getters, get information, querying `(f a) => a is still the same as before` i.e. `(f (f a))` is no valid expresssion or `f` is `id`
idempotent method: setters `(f (f a)) == (f a)` or `(f a) >> (f a) == (f a)`
unsafe method: adding `(f (f a)) /= (f a)` or `(f a) >> (f a) /= (f a)`

== Same-origin policy

.same-origin policy
* permits scripts within web page access to other web page, iff *same origin*, i.e.
.. *URI scheme*, e.g. `http` vs `https`
.. *host name*
.. *port number*:
*** whether implicit vs explicit port number relevant depends on implementation

.same-origin policy; what does it apply to
* mainly to XMLHttpRequest
** also fonts
* images, CSS, and dynamically-loaded scripts are not subject

** determines whether cross-origin requests lead to valid responses
** which properties of the resonse are readable
* under same-origin policy no cross-origin requests are supported
** this is a _restriction enforced by browsers_
* diff.:
** *cross-origin embedding*: script tags
** *cross-origin writes*:
** *cross-origin reading*:

.same-origin policy; methods for relaxing
. document.domain property
. Cross-document messaging
. JSON-P
. Cross-origin resource sharing
. WebSockets

== Same-origin policy: document.domain

* `document.domain` can be set to a suffix of its current domain, e.g.
** `www.example.com` and `net.example.com` are set to `example.com`:
*** now can request each others resources

* setting `document.domain` explicitly can set port to null
** interpreted differently from explicit or implicit ports
** ∴ must be set on both websites to enable communication

== Request modes: Cross-document messaging

* uses `window.postMessage(msg, targetOrigin)` function
* others can receive message via `message` eventListener
** document must be open within browser
* `targetOrigin` must match origins host and protocol

== Request modes: JSON-P

** is replaced by CORS
** html document is injected with `<script>` element
*** only usable with HTTP GET method

* JSON must be configured to be used for JSON-P, i.e.
** must be wrapped with `parseJson()` and used with `eval()` in the browser, e.g.
** instead `{ "foo": "bar", "val": 5 }`: `parseJson({ "foo": "bar", "val": 5 }`

** `parseJson` must be defined within the script that uses JSON-P

== Request modes: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

** CORS defines a alternative mode to same-origin for resource sharing in browsers:
*** scripts must share their origin:
**** i.e. *protocol*, *host*, and *port* must be the same
*** this mode is enforced by browsers
*** if they are different, following restrictions:
**** `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST` method
**** standard Content-Type
**** no custom headers
*** if restrictions not fulfilled:
**** browser sends CORS OPTIONS request to determine whether okay
** *CORS OPTIONS request* includes:
*** several headers starting with `Access-Control-*`
*** browser does a *preflight*:
**** sends `OPTIONS` HTTP method to server
***** contains `Origin` header denoting host sending the request
**** diff. further request headers:
***** `Access-Control-Request-Method:` is method supported?
***** `Access-Control-Request-Headers:` are headers supported?
**** e.g. a request whether DELETE is supported:

----
OPTIONS /resource/foo
Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
Access-Control-Request-Headers: origin,x-requested-with
Origin: http://foo.bar.org/
----

* server passes an *answer to preflight*:
** diff. possible answers:
*** an error page stating it doesn't support CORS
*** response containg requests, authorization, and identity:
**** with response with server headers, describing further procedure
**** all of these contain comma separated lists
**** diff. further reponse headers:
***** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: hosts of origins allows; necessary
***** `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: HTTP methods allowed
***** `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: whether server demands [credentials](###credentials)
***** `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: headers that need to be present
***** `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`: ??
***** `Access-Control-Max-Age`: ??
** OpenID or OAuth can provide authorization

== Request modes: WebSockets

** not yet implemented
** modern browsers allow connections to WebSockets without applying same-origin policy
** uses Origin header, like CORS
** a whole other protocol, which looks like HTTP, but behaves differently

== Response message
* status with code + message
* response header fields
* empty line
* optional message body

.Example message

== Status codes

1xx info
2xx success
3xx redirection
4xx client error
5xx server error

== Statelessness

* http by default is a stateless protocol

== Statelessness: Cookies

.cookies
* small piece of data sent by server and saved in server

.cookies; types
. session cookies
. secure cookies
. HttpOnly cookies
. SameSite cookies
. super cookies

'''

// TODO javascript/html examples setting these

.cookies; *session cookie*:
** do not have expiration date <-> persistent cookie
** are deleted when user quits window

.cookies; *secure cookie*:
** can only be transmitted on secure channels adding “Secure” flag

.cookies; *HttpOnly cookie*:
** cannot be accessed by JavaScript client-side (avoid XSS)

.cookies; *SameSite cookie*:
** only accessable from same domain (avoid XSRF)

.cookies; *Super cookie*:
** cookies in TLD

== Statelessness: Web storage

* Web storage:
** `document.localStorage`
** `document.sessionStorage`
* *fragment / named anchor
* ?...=...&...=... for form elements:
** accessed with `document.URIcomponents`


== Tools

* *curl*:
** can be used to make HTTP requests
** headers:
*** `--header|-H`: used to define a header, e.g. `Host: example.com`
*** `--data|-d`: used to send a body, e.g. for a POST request
*** `-X`: used to define the HTTP verb
