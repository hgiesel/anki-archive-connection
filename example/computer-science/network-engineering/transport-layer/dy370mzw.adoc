== Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)

.arq
* *automatic rpepeat request* is an error-control method
* especially used in virtual circuits:
.. guarantees reliable transmission over unreliable connection:
.. used for flow control (form of TCP congestion control)

.arq; sliding window protocol
* based on the *sliding window protocol* and its primitives:

.arq; sliding window protocol; primitives
. ∃ three kinds of *control frames*:
.. "ACKs": positive acknowledgement
.. "NAKs": negative acknowledgement
.. "ENQs": commands receiver to report status
. ∃ two kinds of windows:
.. "Transmit window": amount of messages sendable without having an ACK
.. "Receive/Congestion window": amount of messages receivable after missing out one
. timeouts

.arq; disadvantages
* needs a back channel
* higher latency due to retransmissions
* requires maintenance of buffers (windows) and timers

== ARQ protocols

.arq protocols; Stop-and-wait
* sends one frame at a time:
.. transmit window = 1
.. receive window  = N ≥ 1
* sender retransmits if it doesn't get an ACK before timeout:
** does so until it receives an ACK or fails a predefined number of retransmissions
** no need for NAK, or ENQ

.arq protocols; Stop-and-wait; amiguities
.. ACK is lost:
*** causes duplicate frame to be sent
.. premature timeout:
*** frame 0 is accepted by receiver and ACK is sent, but after sender already resent it
*** sender will resend frame 0 and get first ACKs
*** sender sends frame 1, which is lost, and gets ACK for second frame 0
*** sender sends frame 2...

* can be solved by using either:
... ENQ control frames (that are echoed with ACK, or NAK)
... sequence numbers

.arq protocols; Go-Back-N
* requires sequence numbering
* sender continues to send N frames even without ACK:
.. transmit window = N ≥ 1
.. receive window = 1

* if message is lost, receiver will either:
.. stop sending ACKs: produces a timeout
.. send a NAK, e.g. in form of a DUPACK
* sender will send jump back N, if it misses out N ACKs

.arq protocols; Selective Repeat
* other forms of ARQ must resend every frame after initial error
* here, receiver will buffer and acknowledge out of order frames after error:
.. transmit window = N ≥ 1
.. receive window = M ≥ 1

* requires NAK messages:
** receiver may selectively reject single frames, which are retransmitted alone
* SACKs work like inverse NAKs:
** everything not selectively ACKed is implicitly rejected
