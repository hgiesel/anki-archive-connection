== Ports
.port 0
* port 0 is reserved,
** ! permissible source port, if no messages are expected in response

.port ranges; 0-1023
* well-known ports, for common services
* require sudo on Linux

.port ranges; 1024-49151
* registered ports, for IANA-registered services

.port ranges; 49152-65535
* private/dynamic ports, not designated for any specific purpose,
* software running on host may randomly choose a port in order to define itself
* used as temporary ports primarily by clients when communicating with server

== Network sockets

.network socket
* internal endpoint for two-way communication link between two programs
** need to run on the network
** bound to IP address and port number:
*** transport layer protocols can identify program data is sent to

.difference network socket and port numbers (1-2)
* sockets are local, unlike port numbers
* internet socket is characterized by:
.. local socket address (IP address + port number)
.. protocol:
*** e.g.TCP port 53, UDP port 53 are distinct sockets; raw IP doesn't have ports

.network sockets; in OS terms
* form of system resource
** in form entry in a table (listing protocol, destination, status, etc.)
** offers programming interface for applications
* constitutes a form of interprocess communication (IPC)
** next to message queues, shared memory, pipes, etc.

.background of term "socket"
* name is analogous to female connectors
** two male connector plugging into sockets at each node
** similiarly "port" is used for external edpoints at a node
** socket is also used for an internal endpoint of local IPC

.define plug, connector, ports, jack, socket regarding computer hardware (5)
* *plug* is the end of a cable that connect to something
* *connector* is the unique end of a plug, or edge of a card
* *ports* are the endpoints on machine/device:
** sometimes also called *jack* (e.g. audio jack)
* *socket* is an opening designed to fit another device

== Use in application programs

.socket descriptors (2)
* *socket descriptors* used by processes to refer to sockets
** type of handle (abstract reference, usually integer)
* process requests socket from OS / protocol stack:
** stack returns descriptor, so process can identify socket
** process passes descriptor to protocol stack when receiving/sending data

.Blocking and non-blocking mode
* a blocking socket does not return control until it has sent/received some of
* all data specified for operation

.blocking sockets
* with blocking sockets, special consideration must be given to accept():
** may still block after indicating readability
** only one may be active at any time in one thread
** easier than non-blocking sockets (not asynchronous)
** creating more threads with each one socket creates a lot of overhead

.non-blocking sockets; methods (3)
* non-blocking sockets return receive buffer and immediately continue
* if not written correctly, susceptible to race conditions 
** âˆµ variances in network link speed

* different ways to implement them
.. polling
.. event-based
.. overlapped I/O
