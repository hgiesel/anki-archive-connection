== TCP connections in the OS

.TCP session identification in OS (2)
* most implementations allocate table mapping sessions to OS processes
** when packet received, lookup is performed on this table
* ! TCP packets do not contain session identifiers:
** ∴ use network sockets to identify

.TCB; contents (2)
* *TCB*, Transmission control block, are entries in the TCP connection table
* contains various information about the endpoints:
** e.g. status of connection, windows sizes, next seqno, ssthresh, MSS, etc.

.TCP connection limit in OS (1,2,2)
* server's number of sessions:
.. only limited by memory
*** can grow as new connections arrive

* client's number of sessions:
.. must allocate a random port before sending first SYN to server:
*** this port remains allocated during the whole conversation
*** effectively limits number of outgoing connection from each of client's IP addresses
.. if application fails to properly close unrequired connections ⇒ client can run out of resources:
*** become unable to establish new TCP connection

* both endpoints must also allocate space for:
** unacknowledged packets (transmit buffer)
** received (but unread) data (receive buffer)

== TCP connections in the OS: Forcing data delivery

* ∃ ways to skip buffers and force data delivery:
.. `TCP_NODELAY` socket option:
*** disables *Nagle's algorithm*:
*** normally, TCP has 200 ms send delays to group small messages into packet
*** creates small, potentially serious delays during file transfer

.. `PSH` bit:
*** signals receiver to push data immediately to application
*** ! no way to control in user space using Berkeley sockets

* e.g. in `telnet` each keystroke echoed back ⇒ very annoying if it was grouped

== Vulnerabilities

.SYN flood attack (3)
* send multiple SYN packets but don't reset ∴ TCP RST
** connection table fills up
** consumes large amounts of resources keeping track of bogus connections
* possible countermeasure: real-time analysis of network by intelligent firewall
* ∃ similiar attacks like PSH and ACK floods, or Sockstress

TODO
.Connection hijacking
* attacker who is able to eavesdrop a TCP
