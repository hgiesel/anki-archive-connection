== Overview

.overview of terms reliability, same-order delivery, connection-orientation (3)
* reliability, and same-order delivery two wanted features for network protocols
.. connectionless services: no same-order per se, maybe reliability
.. connection-oriented services: same-order, maybe reliability:

.purpose of transport layer (2)
* host-to-host communication services for applications via programming interface
* conveyed to applications via *network sockets*, identifier of process-to-process communications
** combination of IP address and port number

.L4 protocols' services (6)
Reliability::
Same-order delivery::
Connection-oriented communication::

Flow control::
Congestion control::

.multiplexing on the transport layer (2)
Multiplexing::
* provides multiple endpoints on single node under single network address
* uses statistical multiplexing (*STDM*) of data from application processes:
** by forming data segments, adding source and destination port numbers to each one

* ! in OSI, this is part of the *session layer*
** transport layer only provides an contextless stream of data

== Reliability

.reliability in network protocols; how achieved (1;2)
* property of network protocols to wait for each transaction to finish:
.. may be in the nature of the connection (physical link)
.. may be emulated by some manner e.g. notifications to sender
*** i.e. a service notifies the user whether delivery succeeded

.disadvantages of reliability (1)
* ∃ disadvantages:
.. usually more overhead than unreliable protocols ∴ less scalable

== Same-order delivery

.same-order delivery for network protocols; relation to connection orientation (1-2)
* property of network protocols to transmit data in the same order it was sent
** connection-mode implies same-order delivery
** ↯ does not imply reliability

== Connection orientation: Connection-mode services

.types of connnection-mode services (2)
* implies either:
.. *circuit-switched connection*
.. *packet-switched connection in virtual circuit mode*

== Connection orientation: Connectionless-mode services

.connectionless-mode services (1-2)
* provides only *best-effort*:
.. i.e. no guarantees for packet loss, duplication, out-of-sequence delivery, etc.
.. may be reduced by implementing error-control procedures

.connectionless-mode connection (2)
* *practical connection*, rather than logical connection:
.. messages routed independently of other messages via destination addresses
.. no establishment of persistent circuit required before data transmission
.. channel becomes free after data transmission

.advantages and disadvantages of connectionless-mode services (3)
* ∃ advantages and disadvantages:
.. have low overhead beforehand
.. have constant overhead because of addresses
.. allow for multicast, and broadcast
