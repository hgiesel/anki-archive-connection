== Attributes
.UDP; features (2)
* message-oriented/transaction-oriented transport layer protocol
* minimum of protocol mechanisms:
.. checksums for data integrity
.. stateless and connectionless

.use cases for UDP (6)
* use cases for UDP include:
.. suitable for simple-response protocols, such as DNS, or NTP
.. works well for broadcasting information
*** used in service discovery, like RIP

.. stateless ∴ suitable for large number of clients:
*** e.g. in streaming media applications
.. lack of retransmission delays ∴  suitable for RT application:
*** VoIP, online games, and protocols built upon RTSP

.. simple ∴  suitable for bootstrapping without a full protocol stack:
*** DHCP, TFTP
.. provides datagrams ∴ suitable for modeling other protocols:
*** IP tunneling, RPC, NFS

== UDP datagram structure
.UDP header structure; features (1,1,2)

SrcPort (16 bit)::
DstPort (16 bit)::
* server likely uses well-know port
* client likely uses ephemeral port

Length (16 bit)::
* length of UDP header and UDP data

Checksum (16 bit)::
* optional in IPv4, mandatory in IPv6:
** carries all zeroes if unused
* if used, works the same as the TCP checksum:
** UDP pseudo header, and padded UPD data

== Comparison to TCP
.comparison with TCP on reliability, same-order delivery; overhead; PDU
Reliablity::
* UDP lacks reliability
* UDP applications must be generally willing to accept some loss
** e.g. TFTP adds some rudimentary reliability mechanisms
* some application may not be hindered by it:
** e.g. streaming media, realtime multiplayer, and VoIP are examples
* TCP has acknowledgements, timeouts, or retransmissions:
** multiple attempts to deliver message are made
** if lost along the way, server will rerequest the lost part
** either no missing data, or connection is dropped

Ordering::
* in UDP, the ordering cannot be predicted
* in TCP, when data segments arrive in wrong order, TCP buffers delay the out-of-order data

Weight::
* UDP is a very lightweight, small transport layer protocol
* TCP requires three packages to set up socket connection, before any user can send

PDU::
* in TCP, data is read as byte stream
** no distinguishing indicatinons are transmitted to signal message boundaris
* in UDP, packets are sent individually and checked for integrity if they arrive
** packets have definite boundaries which are honored upon receipt
** i.e. read operation at receiver socket will yield entire messge, as it was sent
