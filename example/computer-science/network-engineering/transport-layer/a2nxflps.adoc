= TCP Congestion Control in a broad sense
:stats: transport-layer:a2nxflps,0,96

== Congestion

.signs of congestion (5)
* ∃ signs of congestion:
.. packet loss
.. long waiting time
.. frequent retransmissions
.. performance degredation
.. network/congestive collapse

.possible causes of network congestion (2)
* ∃ two possible causes for congestions:
** both are addressed separately

.motivation for flow control; examples (2;1)
Receiver capacity::
* receiver cannot process data fast enough ∴ receive window becomes full:
** flow control prevents sender from overwhelming receiver & buffer overrun

* includes e.g.
.. ARQ with NAKs, or missing ACKs:
*** ! ARQ may keep network in congested state (no congestion control)

.motivation for congestion control; examples (2;3)
Network capacity::
* utilization of network exceeds capabilities:
** reduction of data rate is only useful reaction
** ∴ *congestion control*

* includes e.g.:
.. Active queue management (AQM)
.. Explicit congestion notification (ECN)
.. TCP congestion control
*** TCP tries by changing window size dynamically

== Congestion window

.congestion window; relation to other buffers (2)
* maintained by sender
* measure to stop link from becoming overloaded with too much traffic:
** determines number of bytes that can be outstanding at any time
** calculated by estimating current congestion on link
** limits transmit window

Transmit window::
* how much can I send out without having an ACK
* been sent, but not yet ACKed
* ready to be sent

Advertised Receive window (rwnd)::
* advertises the amount of data destination side can receive:
** especially, buffer after receiving an out-of-order segment
* if receive window is full, sender is blocked until TCP window update

Congestion window (cwnd)::
* limits amount of data you can send into network before receiving an ACK
* how much do I want to sent as not to overwhelm my server

* keeps increasing up to maximum receiver window, or until network reaches its limit
* ! rate of sending data is bound to congestion window
* congestion is detected either by receipt of duplicate acknowledgement or
* timeout signal
* once happens, sender decreases send rate by decreasing congestion window size
* by a factor determined by the algorithm

.effective window
** the effective window is "advertised receive window ∧ congestion window"

.silly window syndrome (2)
* a problem in networking caused by poorly implemented TCP flow control
* if receiver window is small:
** large number of segments with very little data are sent
** increases the overall load on the network and the receiver
* if receive window full, shouldn't be notified until maybe a quarter free

.TCP tuning (2)
* system administrator may:
.. adjust maximum size limit of congestion window
.. adjust constant added during additive increase

== Classification

.network congestion mechanisms; criteria for classification
* ∃ different ways to classify congestion control algorithms:
.. by *incremental deployability*:
*** sender, receiver, router, or all need modification
.. by *type and amount of feedback*:
*** Loss, delay, single-bit, multiple-bit explicit signals

.. by *addressed performance aspects*:
*** high bandwidth-delay, lossy link, fairness, advantage to short flows
.. by *fairness measure*:
*** max-min, proportional, etc.

.network congestion mechanisms; list by incremental deployability (5)
. *Reliability*:
** a necessity
** see <<!:1gna7qxj,Transport layer in OSI>>
. *ARQ*:
** constitutes *sender protocols*
** ensures reliable same-order delivery over unreliable links
** see <<!:dy370mzw,Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)>>

. *AQM*:
** constitutes *router protocols*
** regulates the arbitrary reorder or drop of network packets under load
** mainly operating at IP layer
** see <<!network-layer:glfuo57m,Active Queue Management (AQM)>>

. *ECN*:
** constitutes a *sender-router-receiver protocol*
** adds a flow control mechanism to TCP/IP
** see <<!network-layer:glfuo57m,Active Queue Management (AQM)>>

. *TCP Congestion Control*:
** constitutes *sender protocols*
** how much of advertised receive buffer is utilized in sender
** see <<!:iz4lq9xa,TCP Congestion Control in a narrow sense>>
