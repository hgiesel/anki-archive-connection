= Application layer in OSI
:stats: transport-layer:8l5yfneg,0,56

== Session layer
.L5 protocols' service (3)
. session management
** session setup and torndown, checkpointing and recovery
** multiplexing for proper combination/synchronization of different streams
. authentication
. authorization

.OSIs L5 versus TCP/IP (2)
.Comparison with TCP/IP
* OSI's session management for transport protocols (TCP, SCTP) is contained in those:
* otherwise considered to be in realm of application layer protocols

== Sessions
.L5 sessions (1-4)
* semi-permanent dialogues between local and remote application
.. set up at one point, torn down at a later point
.. checkpointing and recovery of dialogues
.. simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex transmission of messages
.. typically, stateful

.examples of sessions (4)
.Examples of sessions
. HTTP sessions, which allow associating information with visitors
. telnet remote login sessions
. TCP session, which is synonymous to an established TCP socket
** graceful termination of sessions is a property of TCP
. RPC sessions

== Presentation layer
.L6; alternative name (2;1)
* the data translator for the network:
** lowest layer at which application programmers consider data structures
** delivers and formats information for application layer processing or display
** relieves L7 of dealing with data representation differences between systems
** L7 points at data to be moved, and L6 will deal with rest
* sometimes called the *syntax layer*

.L6 services (4)
* L6 services:
.. data encryption/decryption
.. data compression
.. character/string encoding, or object representation
*** e.g. files with different encodings, Pascal vs. C string encodings, or XML
.. graphic handling

== Application layer

.L7 in TCP/IP suite and OSI model
* application layer exists in both TCP/IP suite and OSI model:
.. contains communication protocols and interface methods:
*** protocol to establish host-to-host data transfer and manage data exchange
*** no specific rules or data formats applications must consider
.. OSI model's L7 much narrower in scope:
*** user interface responsible for displaying received information to the user

.robustness principle
* original specification of TCP/IP suite recommends guideline for design:
** called *robustness principle*:
** "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"

== Service requests

.service requests
* valid in OSI model (and to some degree in TCP/IP suite):
** lower layers answer to service requests of upper layers

.examples of service requests (4)
. L4 asks L3 for datagrams and assembles a coherent data stream
. L5 asks L4 for data stream filters out different sessions
. L6 asks L5 for sessions and filters out type of data / decrypts / etc.
. L7 asks L6 for user data in specific format and hands it to user application
