== TCP Options

.TCP options structure; location (1;3)
* appended to the TCP segment
* options have up to three fields:

Option-Kind (1-byte)::
** only mandatory field
** some options only settable during connection establishment
Option-Length (1-byte)::
** length of complete option (≥ 2)
Option-Data (variable)::

.EOL, and NOP options (2)
End of options List (0)::
** not sure when this is actually used
NOP (1)::
** used as padding
** maybe used to align option fields on word boundaries for better performance

== TCP Timestamps

.TCP timestamps; adaption (2;1)
* helps TCP determine order in which packets were sent:
.. normally might start at random value, i.e. not aligned to system clock
.. usually incremented by miliseconds
* adaption stagnated at about 40 percent of routers

.structure of TCP timestamp option (2)
Timestamp (8,10,TTTT,EEEE)::
** ∃ two timestamp fields:
... 4-byte sender timestamp value
... 4-byte echo reply timestamp value (most recent timestamp received)

.PAWS; connection to TCP timestamps (1;1)
* timestamps are used in an algorithm called PAWS:
** Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers
* when receive window crosses the sequence number wraparound boundary:
** "Is this packet in the first 4 GB or second?"

== Sliding window algorithm

.selective acknowledgements
* generally, TCP uses Go-Back-N ARQ:
** ! can use Selective-Repeat ARQ (SACK)
** enabled with `SACK permitted option`

* negotiated during connection establishment i.e. not mandatory:
** ! use of SACK has become widespread, all popular TCP stacks support it

.selective acknowledgements; operation
* *SACK blocks* are the received out-of-order packages
* defined in ACKs in the `SACK` option, with:

.selective acknowledgements; edges
. Left edge:
** starting sequence number of hold-on package
. Right edge:
** ending sequence number of hold-on package

* retransmits ACK with `SACK` option, until all blocks received, then:
.. drops the SACK
.. acknowledges right edge

.selective acknowledgements; D-SACK
* TCP sender can interpret SACKs as sign of packet loss:
** ∴ slows data delivery rate
** ! can also be because of other reasons:
*** e.g. was in previous transmission, aquired data another way, etc.

* *D-SACK* (duplicate SACK) is an extension to SACK option:
** if sent, sender can reinstate higher transmission rate

.selective acknowledgements; D-SACK; options in TCP
. "SACK permitted (4,2)":
** only settable during connection establishment
** selective acknowledges are permitted for connection

. "SACK (5,N,BBBB,CCCC,[DDDD,EEEE,FFFF,GGGG,HHHH,IIII])":
** N is `n8 + 2`, where `n ∈ {1,2,3,4}`
** up to 4 sequence number ranges of already received data

== Maximum segment size

.MSS; connection to fragmentation (2;2)
* largest amount of data bytes TCP is willing to receive in single segment
* one MSS value for each direction
** e.g. one device participating may have extremely limited memory reserved

* IP fragmentation causes packet loss, and  excessive transsmission
** ∴ MSS is set to avoid IP fragmentation and better performance

.MSS differences and relation to MTU (2)
* ↯ unlike MTU, it doesn't contain the header (TCP, nor IP)
* default (minimum, MTU - IP header - TCP header), e.g.:
.. 536 (576 - 20 - 20) for IPv4
.. 1220 (1280 - 40 - 20) for IPv6

.MSS agreement (2)
* MSS option is set during connection establishment:
.. either derived from data link layer MTU (e.g. path MTU discovery)
.. set with TCP MSS option

.structure of MSS option (2)
Maximum segment size/MSS (2,4,SS)::
** only settable during connection establishment
** largest amount of data receivable within single segment
*** i.e. similiar to MTU for L3
