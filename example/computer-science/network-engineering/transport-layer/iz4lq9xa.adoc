== Operations in TCP congestion control

.operating stages in TCP congestion control (5)
* slow start
* linear growth
* aimd
* fast retransmit
* fast recovery

== Slow start

.slow start
* method of initial increase of the congestion window:
** e.g. after a connection initializion, or timeout
** starts with initial congestion window size (cwnd) of 1, 2, 4, or 10 MSS

* for every acknowledged packet, congestion window increases by 1 MSS:
** until `ssthresh` is reached, then enters *linear growth*
** i.e. it doubles for every round-trip time (RTT)

.slow start; disadvantages
. assumes unacknowledged packages are due to network congestion
** usually true, but not necessarily
** e.g. errors in data transmission due to poor wireless reception
. performs badly for short-lived connections

== Linear growth algorithm

.linear growth algorithm (3)
* cwnd grows by `1/(cwnd window)` MSS on each ACK
** i.e. grows by 1 MSS for every RTT

* keeps growing until timeout:
** i.e. receiver window (rwnd) is the limiting factor

* if loss occurs, it is assumed, it is because network congestion:
.. `ssthreash ≔ cwnd/2`, sstresh is set to half the congestion window size
.. `cwnd ≔ initial_cwnd`, cwnd is reset to inital size (e.g. 1 MSS)
.. slow start is reinitiated

.Additive increase/multiplicative decrease (AIMD)
.AIMD (3)
* an implementation of the linear growth algorithm
* stands for Additive increase/multiplicative decrease
* multiple flows using AIMD congestion control eventually converge:
** i.e. they use equal amounts of contented link

* combines:
.. linear growth of congestion window
.. exponential reduction when congestion happens

----
w(t + 1) = { w(t) + a, if congestion occured
           { w(t) × a, if congestion is detected

== Fast retransmit

.TCP Fast retransmit (3)
* enhancement to TCP, reducing time sender waits before retransmitting
** i.e. resends before timeout
** *DUPACKs* are the basis for the fast retransmit mechanism:

* if segment in a stream lost, receiver cannot acknowledge anything above it:
** e.g. if segment 100 lost, receiver will acknowledge 99 again

* if sender receives three DUPACKs, retransmits last unacknowledged segment:
** packet was presumed dropped anyway, sender was just waiting for its timeout
** requires 3 DUPACKs ∴ avoids *spurious retransmissions* due to reordering

.Fast recovery
.TCP Fast recovery (2)
* retransmits missing packet as signaled by three DUPACKs
* waits for entire transmit window to be ACKed:
.. if ACK, returns to congestion avoidance (i.e. no low start)
.. if no ACK, Reno experiences a timeout and enters slow start

== TCP Tahoe and Reno

.compare TCP Tahoe and Reno (3)
* named after 4.3BSD operating systems
* both consider retransmission timeout (RTO) and duplicate ACKs (DUPACKs):
** differ in how they react to DUPACKs

.Tahoe
** three DUPACKs are received (4 altogether) ⇒
... Fast retransmit
... `sthresh ≔ cwnd / 2`
... `cwnd ≔ 1 MSS`
... Slow start

.Reno
** three DUPACKs are received (4 altogether) ⇒
... Fast retransmit
... `cwnd = cwnd / 2`
... `sthresh ≔ cwnd`
... Fast recovery

== TCP New Reno

.tcp new reno
* improves upon TCP Reno:
** retransmission during Fast recovery phase of TCP Reno

* during Fast recovery:
.. every additional DUPACK ⇒ new unsent packet from end of cwnd is sent
.. keeps transmit window full
.. sender assumes ACKs point to new hole
*** for every ACK that makes partial progress in sequence space
.. next packet beyond ACKed sequence is sent

* timeout timer resets whenever progress in transmit buffer:
** allows New Reno to fill large holes or multiple holes
** works much like TCP SACK

.tcp new reno; problems
* if packets are reordered by more than 3 packet sequence numbers
** ⇒ New Reno mistakenly enters fast recovery
* when reordered packet is delivered, ACK seqno progress occurs
** ⇒ every bit of seqno progress produces duplicate and needless retransmission

.tcp new reno; paractical use
* TCP New Reno most commonly implemented algorithm:
** usually with SACK support
* nowadays Linux uses TCP BIC, and TCP CUBIC:
** tries to find maximum where to keep window at by using a binary search algorithm
