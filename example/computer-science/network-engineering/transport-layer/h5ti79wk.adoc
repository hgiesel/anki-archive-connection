== Overview

.other protocols; Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
* message-oriented transport layer protocol:
.. acknowledged connectionless protocol
.. teardown of connections
.. ECN, and feature negotiation:
*** no need to implement them at application layer

* flow-like semantics like TCP without reliable in-order delivery:
** sequenced delivery within multiple streams not possible
** âˆµ no handshake
* implemented in Linux

.other protocols; Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
* message-oriented like UDP
** possible to tunnel SCTP over UDP
* ensures reliable, in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP
* provides:
** multi-homing
** redundant paths
** increases resilience and reliability

.other protocols; Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
* designed to reserve resources across a network for quality of service (QoS)
* uses integrated services model
** a precursor to DiffServ
* does not transport application data, but is similiar to ICMP or IGMP

.other protocols; Reliable Data Protocol (RDP)
* connection oriented, but does not require sequenced delivery of segments

.other protocols; Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP)
* extends UDP by:
** Acknowledgement of received packets (reliability)
** Windows and flow control
** Retransmission of lost packets (ARQ)
** Over buffering

.other protocols; Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC)
* heavily utilized in Chrome

.other protocols; Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC); purpose
* supports a set of multiplexed connections between two endpoints over UDP
* main goal to improve perceived performance of web applications using TCP:
.. reduce/compress redundant data transmissions (like headers)
*** make numerous HTTP requests within single initial congestion window
.. reduced connection and transport latency, and bandwidth estimation in each direction:
*** to avoid congestion
.. no congestion avoidance:
*** moves algorithms into application space, rather than kernel spacel
.. provides security protection equivalent to TLS:
*** no need for TLS itself
