== Packet switching

.packet switching
* routing and transferring of data by means of:
.. addressed packets with header and payload
.. channel only occupied during transmission, made available after completion

.packet switching; example
* e.g. cellular communications

.packet switching; how are they charactized
* characterized by amount of data exchanged

== Circuit switching

.circuit switching
* preallocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for communication:
.. incurs small overhead
.. connection-oriented and reliable by nature
.. constant bit rate and latency between nodes

.circuit switching; example
* e.g. cellular communications, or telephone network:

.circuit switching; how are they characterized
* characterized by fee per unit of connection time even without data exchange

== Virtual circuits

.virtual circuits
* imitates dedicated physical link between hosts on packet-switched network:
.. requires some sort of connection establishment and identifier:
*** routing information associated with a *Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI)*
*** allows a bit stream to be delivered between nodes
.. same-order delivery is emulated:
*** e.g. reordering of segments via segment numbering

.virtual circuits; synonyms
* synomymous with *virtual connection*, or *virtual channel*

.virtual circuits; similarities to circuit switching
* both connection oriented:
.. signaling overhead required during connection establishment
.. same-order delivery
* differences:
.. circuit switching has a constant bit rate and latency:
*** varying packet queue lengths, bit rates, or network loads alters those of virtual circuits
.. virtual circuits are not necessarily reliable (ARQ)

.virtual circuits; examples in TCP
* e.g. TCP allows connection-mode delivery through connectionless IP:
.. requires two-way synchronization
.. uses segment sequence numbering, and packet buffering for packet reordering

.virtual circuits; examples in L2/L3
* e.g. virtual circuit on L2/L3 means:
.. all data is sent over the _same path_, i.e. same nodes
*** unlike L4, host can not reorder data before handing it over to application
.. routers essentially become switches âˆ´ faster with higher capacity
.. bandwidth reservation during connection establishment enables QoS procedures
