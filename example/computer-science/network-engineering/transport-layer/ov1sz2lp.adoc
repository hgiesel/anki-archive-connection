= TCP Basics and Segment Structure
:stats: transport-layer:ov1sz2lp,0,122

== Introduction

.tcp; relation IP and TCP (1)
* was specified along IPv4

.tcp; design decisions (2)
* optimized for accuracy, rather than timely deliver:
** handles errors of the connectionless, no-integrity IP
** can produce timeouts of more than a second

.tcp; importance of connection-orientedness
* process-to-process communication has several desired properties
* are not provided by L3 protocol (IP):
** TCP provides them instead

.PDU of TCP; size of header; size (3)
* *segments* are the units of TCP:
** message is divided into individual units of data
** reassambled for user application at receiver

* TCP header size is at least 20 bytes:
** options can make it longer
* length of segment doesn't have dedicated field:
** IP packet size minus the IP header size

== TCP segment structure

.TCP header
* TCP data is encapsulated in an IP datagram
* its normal size is 20 bytes, unless options are sets

.TCP header; graphic
image::http://www.ssfnet.org/Exchange/tcp/Graphics/tcpHeader1.gif[TCP header]


.TCP header; structure
. "SrcPort (16 bit)"
. "DstPort (16 bit)"
. "Sequence number (32 bit)"
. "Acknowledgement number (32 bit)"

. "Data offset (4 bit)"
. "Flag fields (12 bits)"
. "Advertised window size (16 bit)"
. "TCP checksum (16 bit)"
. "Urgent pointer (16 bit)"
. "[Options]"

.Data offset (4 bit)
* same as `IHL` in IPv4
* specifies TCP header in 32-bit words
* minimum of 5, to maximum of 15:
** i.e. a maximum of 10 32-bit words of options are allowed

== TCP segment structure: Flags

.TCP header flags (except first three) (3,6)
.Flag fields (12 bits)
.Reserved (3-bit)
. NS/CWR/ECE
* needed for congestion control

.flag fields; URG
* signifies that this segment contains urgent data:
** urgent pointer indicates where the *non-urgent data* contained in this segment begins

.flag fields; ACK
* acknowledgement number only valid, if flag is set:
** this is the case every time after the first SYN

.flag fields; PSH
* sender invoked push operation:
** indicates to receiver it should push the received segment directly to end-user process

.flag fields; RST
* used during connection establishment:
** server is confused and wants to abort the connection
** this can happen after server got the first SYN, but no response from its SYN/ACK

.flag fields; SYN
* used for establishing a TCP connection
.flag fields; FIN
* used for terminating a TCP connection

== Window scaling

.advertised window field; limit
* size of the sender's *receive winow*
* larger advertised window allows more efficient use of high-bandwidth network:
** limited to value between 2 and 65,535
** ! can be enlarged with windows scaling factor

.TCP windows update
* a TCP windows update is a segment similiar to an acknowledgement:
** sent if the available memory of the receiving process changes
** i.e. only thing changed is the advertised window field

.window scaling factor; structure
** only settable during connection establishment
** scaling factor counts per direction
** represents bits to left shift the 16-bit field

** can be set from 0 to 14, for a maximum value of up to 1 gigabyte
*** e.g. a value of 2 would mean two left shifts: 5 would become 20

== TCP Checksum

.TCP checksum field; processing
* checksum covers the TCP pseudo header
* must be calculated by sender and then verified by receiver

.TCP checksum computation (4)
* defined in RFC 768:
** one's complements of one's complement sum of 16-bit words in header and text
** if packet contains odd number of octets, it is padded to form 16-bit word
** the pad isn't transmitted as part of the packet
** during checksum computation, checksum field itself is replaced with zeroes

.structure of TCP pseudo header (6)
* uses a TCP pseudo header:
.. source IP address [4 byte iff IPv4 or 16 byte iff IPv6]
.. destination IP address [4 byte iff IPv4 or 16 byte iff IPv6]

.. [4 byte TCP length iff IPv6]
.. [1 byte, IP protocol, 2 bytes TCP length (header + padded data)] iff IPv4, or
*** [3 bytes zero, Next header] iff IPv6

.. TCP header with checksum field all set to zero
.. TCP data

.Checksum offload
.checksum offload; issues (2)
* many TCP/IP stack implementations have options for hardware assistance
** automatically computes checksum in network adapter prior to transmission
** relieves OS from using CPU cycles to calculate the checksum
* may cause packet analyzers to report invalid checksums for outbound packets:
** same issue may occur on VMs


== Out-of-band data

.comparison of out-of-band data and normal data (3,3)
* normally the receiver of data will:
.. wait till stream is finished
.. assemble received segments into data
.. push it to the application
* sender can specify data as *urgent*:
.. receiver interrupts/aborts queued stream instead until stream finishes
.. tells receiving program to process it immediately
.. when finished, TCP informs application and resumes with the stream queue

.out-of-band data examples (1)
* e.g. used in remote login sessions, like Telnet or SSH:
** user sends keyboard sequence that needs computed immediately, e.g. signals
** signal sent without waiting for program to finish its current transfer:
*** e.g. when program on remote machine fails to operate correctly

.Issues
.issues of out-of-band data; consequence (2;1)
* TCP OOB wasn't designed for modern Internet:
.. no expedition of processing on the network, just on remote receiver
* on remote host, ∃ two slightly different interpretations of OOB:
** ∴ only single bytes of data are reliable

* least used protocol feature, usually poorly implemented
