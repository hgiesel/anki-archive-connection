== Overview

* divided into several *topics*, which are directories containing:
.. a `README.adoc`
.. an optional `assets` directory containing diagrams, scripts, etc.
.. asciidoc files containing information on the topic

* each file is divided into questions, which usually are a block
** the block answers the question posed

== Question tags

.question tags; list
* `:1:`: normal question tag
* `:100:`: subtag to `:1:`
* `:101t:`: are solely questions/tasks, and don't contain any new information
* `:102f:`: needs a fix

.question tags; interaction
* `<ll>t` (only on qtag): copy fully qualified tag of question to copyboard
* `<ll>T`: copy ftag to copyboard
* `<ll>i`: inserts the next available tag in current line (inspects `b:unique_qtags`)

== File/Diagram import

.diagrams; interaction
* `<ml>gr` (only on file/image tag): reveal file/image in file manager
* `<ml>go` (only on file/image tag): open file in default application

* `<ml>ga`: opens the `g:go_assets_to_directory`
* `<ml>gi`: copies files from `g:go_assets_from_directory` to `g:go_assets_to_directory`
** also names it appropriately
* `<ml>gI`: only possible name of file for import/reference

== Anki interaction

.Anki interaction; commands
* `<ll>q` (only on qtag): copy Anki query to copyboard
* `<ll>Q`: copy paragraph into copyboard

== Guidelines

.guidelines; code and math
* for inline: always use `foo`!
* for block: always use

.guidelines; foo
----
foo
----

.guidelines; blocks
* blocks which are not just listings, usually have the `:ext:` tag

.guidelines; other
* don't use "dlists"!
** use `a: b` instead, make `a` bold if appropriate

.guidelines external sources
* for assets, become content: only allowed in fences:
.. `include::`: for literally importing files, usually within `----` block
* for assets, become content: only allowed as standalone blocks:
.. `image::`: for placing a picture, can only have a block title, no bullets!
.. `video::`: same as image

* not for assets, not content!! allowed in flowing text
.. `link:`: references other files (topics) / urls / sources
*** often used with `//`

== Important variables

* b:ftag
* b:qtags_unique
* b:qtags_duplicate
* b:qtags_references
* b:qtags_references_dangling
* b:file_references
* b:file_references_dangling
