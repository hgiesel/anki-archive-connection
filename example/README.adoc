== Explanation

.explanation
* this is an example archive for use with `anki-plus-archive`
* it illustrates how I use my own addon
** it may be to interest to other people, it may not be
** if you're interested:
*** you can read some information about it in the remainder of the document

.explanation; qids
* if you're looking for examples of qids, go to `example/mathematics/graph-theory/behl4q6l.adoc`
** but there are way more, just `grep` for lines starting with `:15`

== Overview

.overview; sections
* divided into several *sections*, which are directories containing:
.. a `README.adoc`
.. an optional `assets` directory containing diagrams, scripts, etc.
.. files containing information on the topic of the section, called pages

.overview; blocks
* each file is divided into questions, which usually are a block
** the block answers the question posed

== Guidelines

.guidelines; code and math
* for inline: always use `foo`!
* for block: always use

.guidelines; code and math; foo
----
foo
----

.guidelines; blocks
* blocks which are not just listings, usually have the `:ext:` tag

.guidelines; other
* don't use "dlists"!
** use `a: b` instead, make `a` bold if appropriate

.guidelines external sources
* for assets, become content: only allowed in fences:
.. `include::`: for literally importing files, usually within `----` block
* for assets, become content: only allowed as standalone blocks:
.. `image::`: for placing a picture, can only have a block title, no bullets!
.. `video::`: same as image

* not for assets, not content!! allowed in flowing text
.. `link:`: references other files (topics) / urls / sources
*** often used with `//`
